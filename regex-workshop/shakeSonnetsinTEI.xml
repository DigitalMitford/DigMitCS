  <div><head>THE SONNETS</head>

  <byline>by William Shakespeare</byline>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="I">
    <l rend="firstLine">From fairest creatures we desire increase,</l>
    <l>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</l>
    <l>But as the riper should by time decease,</l>
    <l>His tender heir might bear his memory:</l>
    <l>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,</l>
    <l>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</l>
    <l>Making a famine where abundance lies,</l>
    <l>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</l>
    <l>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</l>
    <l>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</l>
    <l>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</l>
    <l>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="II">
    <l rend="firstLine">When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</l>
    <l>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</l>
    <l>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,</l>
    <l>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:</l>
    <l>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</l>
    <l>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;</l>
    <l>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,</l>
    <l>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</l>
    <l>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,</l>
    <l>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</l>
    <l>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'</l>
    <l>Proving his beauty by succession thine!</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">This were to be new made when thou art old,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="III">
    <l rend="firstLine">Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest</l>
    <l>Now is the time that face should form another;</l>
    <l>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</l>
    <l>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</l>
    <l>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</l>
    <l>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</l>
    <l>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</l>
    <l>Of his self-love to stop posterity?</l>
    <l>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee</l>
    <l>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;</l>
    <l>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</l>
    <l>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">But if thou live, remember'd not to be,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Die single and thine image dies with thee.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="IV">
    <l rend="firstLine">Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</l>
    <l>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?</l>
    <l>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</l>
    <l>And being frank she lends to those are free:</l>
    <l>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</l>
    <l>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</l>
    <l>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</l>
    <l>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</l>
    <l>For having traffic with thy self alone,</l>
    <l>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:</l>
    <l>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,</l>
    <l>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Which, used, lives th' executor to be.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="V">
    <l rend="firstLine">Those hours, that with gentle work did frame</l>
    <l>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,</l>
    <l>Will play the tyrants to the very same</l>
    <l>And that unfair which fairly doth excel;</l>
    <l>For never-resting time leads summer on</l>
    <l>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;</l>
    <l>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,</l>
    <l>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</l>
    <l>Then were not summer's distillation left,</l>
    <l>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</l>
    <l>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</l>
    <l>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="VI">
    <l rend="firstLine">Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,</l>
    <l>In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:</l>
    <l>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</l>
    <l>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.</l>
    <l>That use is not forbidden usury,</l>
    <l>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</l>
    <l>That's for thy self to breed another thee,</l>
    <l>Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;</l>
    <l>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,</l>
    <l>If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:</l>
    <l>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</l>
    <l>Leaving thee living in posterity?</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="VII">
    <l rend="firstLine">Lo! in the orient when the gracious light</l>
    <l>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</l>
    <l>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</l>
    <l>Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</l>
    <l>And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,</l>
    <l>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</l>
    <l>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</l>
    <l>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</l>
    <l>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</l>
    <l>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</l>
    <l>The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</l>
    <l>From his low tract, and look another way:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="VIII">
    <l rend="firstLine">Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?</l>
    <l>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:</l>
    <l>Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,</l>
    <l>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?</l>
    <l>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</l>
    <l>By unions married, do offend thine ear,</l>
    <l>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</l>
    <l>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</l>
    <l>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</l>
    <l>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</l>
    <l>Resembling sire and child and happy mother,</l>
    <l>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="IX">
    <l rend="firstLine">Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,</l>
    <l>That thou consum'st thy self in single life?</l>
    <l>Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</l>
    <l>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;</l>
    <l>The world will be thy widow and still weep</l>
    <l>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</l>
    <l>When every private widow well may keep</l>
    <l>By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:</l>
    <l>Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend</l>
    <l>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</l>
    <l>But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,</l>
    <l>And kept unused the user so destroys it.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">No love toward others in that bosom sits</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="X">
    <l rend="firstLine">For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,</l>
    <l>Who for thy self art so unprovident.</l>
    <l>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,</l>
    <l>But that thou none lov'st is most evident:</l>
    <l>For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,</l>
    <l>That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,</l>
    <l>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</l>
    <l>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</l>
    <l>O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:</l>
    <l>Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?</l>
    <l>Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,</l>
    <l>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Make thee another self for love of me,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XI">
    <l rend="firstLine">As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,</l>
    <l>In one of thine, from that which thou departest;</l>
    <l>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,</l>
    <l>Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,</l>
    <l>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;</l>
    <l>Without this folly, age, and cold decay:</l>
    <l>If all were minded so, the times should cease</l>
    <l>And threescore year would make the world away.</l>
    <l>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</l>
    <l>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</l>
    <l>Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;</l>
    <l>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XII">
    <l rend="firstLine">When I do count the clock that tells the time,</l>
    <l>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</l>
    <l>When I behold the violet past prime,</l>
    <l>And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;</l>
    <l>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</l>
    <l>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</l>
    <l>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,</l>
    <l>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,</l>
    <l>Then of thy beauty do I question make,</l>
    <l>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</l>
    <l>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake</l>
    <l>And die as fast as they see others grow;</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XIII">
    <l rend="firstLine">O! that you were your self; but, love you are</l>
    <l>No longer yours, than you your self here live:</l>
    <l>Against this coming end you should prepare,</l>
    <l>And your sweet semblance to some other give:</l>
    <l>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</l>
    <l>Find no determination; then you were</l>
    <l>Yourself again, after yourself's decease,</l>
    <l>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</l>
    <l>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</l>
    <l>Which husbandry in honour might uphold,</l>
    <l>Against the stormy gusts of winter's day</l>
    <l>And barren rage of death's eternal cold?</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">You had a father: let your son say so.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XIV">
    <l rend="firstLine">Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;</l>
    <l>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</l>
    <l>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</l>
    <l>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;</l>
    <l>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</l>
    <l>Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</l>
    <l>Or say with princes if it shall go well</l>
    <l>By oft predict that I in heaven find:</l>
    <l>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</l>
    <l>And constant stars in them I read such art</l>
    <l>As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,</l>
    <l>If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Or else of thee this I prognosticate:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XV">
    <l rend="firstLine">When I consider every thing that grows</l>
    <l>Holds in perfection but a little moment,</l>
    <l>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</l>
    <l>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</l>
    <l>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</l>
    <l>Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,</l>
    <l>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</l>
    <l>And wear their brave state out of memory;</l>
    <l>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</l>
    <l>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</l>
    <l>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay</l>
    <l>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">And all in war with Time for love of you,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XVI">
    <l rend="firstLine">But wherefore do not you a mightier way</l>
    <l>Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?</l>
    <l>And fortify your self in your decay</l>
    <l>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</l>
    <l>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</l>
    <l>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</l>
    <l>With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,</l>
    <l>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</l>
    <l>So should the lines of life that life repair,</l>
    <l>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,</l>
    <l>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,</l>
    <l>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XVII">
    <l rend="firstLine">Who will believe my verse in time to come,</l>
    <l>If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?</l>
    <l>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</l>
    <l>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</l>
    <l>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</l>
    <l>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</l>
    <l>The age to come would say 'This poet lies;</l>
    <l>Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'</l>
    <l>So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,</l>
    <l>Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,</l>
    <l>And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage</l>
    <l>And stretched metre of an antique song:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">But were some child of yours alive that time,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XVIII">
    <l rend="firstLine">Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</l>
    <l>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</l>
    <l>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</l>
    <l>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</l>
    <l>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</l>
    <l>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</l>
    <l>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</l>
    <l>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</l>
    <l>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</l>
    <l>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</l>
    <l>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</l>
    <l>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XIX">
    <l rend="firstLine">Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,</l>
    <l>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</l>
    <l>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,</l>
    <l>And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;</l>
    <l>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,</l>
    <l>And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</l>
    <l>To the wide world and all her fading sweets;</l>
    <l>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:</l>
    <l>O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,</l>
    <l>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</l>
    <l>Him in thy course untainted do allow</l>
    <l>For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">My love shall in my verse ever live young.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XX">
    <l rend="firstLine">A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,</l>
    <l>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</l>
    <l>A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted</l>
    <l>With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:</l>
    <l>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</l>
    <l>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</l>
    <l>A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,</l>
    <l>Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.</l>
    <l>And for a woman wert thou first created;</l>
    <l>Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,</l>
    <l>And by addition me of thee defeated,</l>
    <l>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XXI">
    <l rend="firstLine">So is it not with me as with that Muse,</l>
    <l>Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,</l>
    <l>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use</l>
    <l>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</l>
    <l>Making a couplement of proud compare'</l>
    <l>With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,</l>
    <l>With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,</l>
    <l>That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</l>
    <l>O! let me, true in love, but truly write,</l>
    <l>And then believe me, my love is as fair</l>
    <l>As any mother's child, though not so bright</l>
    <l>As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Let them say more that like of hearsay well;</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XXII">
    <l rend="firstLine">My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</l>
    <l>So long as youth and thou are of one date;</l>
    <l>But when in thee time's furrows I behold,</l>
    <l>Then look I death my days should expiate.</l>
    <l>For all that beauty that doth cover thee,</l>
    <l>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</l>
    <l>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</l>
    <l>How can I then be elder than thou art?</l>
    <l>O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary</l>
    <l>As I, not for myself, but for thee will;</l>
    <l>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</l>
    <l>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XXIII">
    <l rend="firstLine">As an unperfect actor on the stage,</l>
    <l>Who with his fear is put beside his part,</l>
    <l>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</l>
    <l>Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;</l>
    <l>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</l>
    <l>The perfect ceremony of love's rite,</l>
    <l>And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,</l>
    <l>O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.</l>
    <l>O! let my looks be then the eloquence</l>
    <l>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</l>
    <l>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</l>
    <l>More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:</l>
    <l rend="closingCouplet">To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg type="sonnet" n="XXIV">
    <l rend="firstLine">Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,</l>
    <l>Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;</l>
    <l>My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,</l>
    <l>And perspective it is best painter's art.</l>
    <l>For through the painter must you see his skill,</l>
    <l>To find where your true image pictur'd lies,</l>
    <l>Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,</l>
    <l>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</l>
    <l>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</l>

    <l>For, thou betraying me, I do betray</l>
    <l>My nobler part to my gross body's treason;</l>
    <l>My soul doth tell my body that he may</l>
    <l>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,</l>

    <l>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,</l>

    <l>But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,</l>
    <l>When I break twenty? I am perjur'd most;</l>
    <l>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,</l>
    <l>And all my honest faith in thee is lost:</l>
