    <p>We know now that in the early years of the twentieth century this world was being watched
        closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that
        as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and
        studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the
        transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence
        people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of
        their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or
        design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense
        ethereal gulf, minds that to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects
        vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely
        drew their plans against us. In the thirty-ninth year of the twentieth century came the
        great disillusionment.</p>
    <p> It was near the end of October. Business was better. The war scare was over. More men were
        back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30, the Crossley
        service estimated that thirty-two million people were listening in on radios.</p>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
    <p>. . .for the next twenty-four hours not much change in temperature. A slight atmospheric
        disturbance of undetermined origin is reported over Nova Scotia, causing a low pressure area
        to move down rather rapidly over the northeastern states, bringing a forecast of rain,
        accompanied by winds of light gale force. Maximum temperature 66; minimum 48. This weather
        report comes to you from the Government Weather Bureau. . . . We now take you to the
        Meridian Room in the Hotel Park Plaza in downtown New York, where you will be entertained by
        the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.</p>

    <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. From the Meridian Room in the Park Plaza in New York
        City, we bring you the music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra. With a touch of the
        Spanish. Ramon Raquello leads off with "La Cumparsita."</p>
    <stage>PIECE STARTS PLAYING</stage>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you a special bulletin
        from the Intercontinental Radio News. At twenty minutes before eight, central time,
        Professor Farrell of the Mount Jennings Observatory, Chicago, Illinois, reports observing
        several explosions of incandescent gas, occurring at regular intervals on the planet Mars.
        The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen and moving towards the earth with enormous
        velocity. Professor Pierson of the Observatory at Princeton confirms Farrell's observation,
        and describes the phenomenon as (quote) like a jet of blue flame shot from a gun (unquote).
        We now return you to the music of Ramon Raquello, playing for you in the Meridian Room of
        the Park Plaza Hotel, situated in downtown New York.</p>

    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, following on the news given in our bulletin a moment ago, the
        Government Meteorological Bureau has requested the large observatories of the country to
        keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances occurring on the planet Mars. Due to
        the unusual nature of this occurance, we have arranged an interview with noted astronomer.
        Professor Pierson, who will give us his views on the event. in a few moments we will take
        you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton, New Jersey. We return you until then to the
        music of Ramon Raquello and his orchestra.</p>

    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>We are now ready to take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton where Carl Phillips,
        or commentator, will interview Professor Richard Pierson, famous astronomer. We take you now
        to Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
    <stage>ECHO CHAMBER. FX: TICK-TOCK SOUND</stage>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Carl Phillips, speaking to you from the
        observatory at Princeton. I am standing in a large semi-circular room, pitch black except
        for an oblong split in the ceiling. Through this opening i can see a sprinkling of stars
        that cast a kind of frosty glow over the intricate mechanism of the huge telescope. The
        ticking sound you hear is the vibration of the clockwork. Professor Pierson stands directly
        above me on a small platform, peering through a giant lens. I ask you to be patient, ladies
        and gentlemen, during any delay that may arise during our interview. Besides his ceaseless
        watch of the heavens, Professor Pierson may be interrupted by telephone or other
        communications. During this period he is in constant touch with the astronomical centers of
        the world . . . Professor, may I begin our questions?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>At any time, Mr. Phillips.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Professor, would you please tell our radio audience exactly what you see as you observe the
        planet Mars through your telescope?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Nothing unusual at the moment, Mr. Phillips. A red disk swimming in a blue sea. Transverse
        stripes across the disk. Quite distinct now because Mars happens to be the point nearest the
        earth . . . in opposition, as we call it.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>In your opinion, what do these transverse stripes signify, Professor Pierson?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Not canals, I can assure you, Mr. Phillips, although that's the popular conjecture of those
        who imagine Mars to be inhabited. From a scientific viewpoint the stripes are merely the
        result of atmospheric conditions peculiar to the planet.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Then you're quite convinced as a scientist that living intelligence as we know it does not
        exist on Mars?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>I'd say the chances against it are a thousand to one.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>And yet how do you account for those gas eruptions occurring on the surface of the planet at
        regular intervals?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Mr. Phillips, I cannot account for it.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>By the way, Professor, for the benefit of our listeners, how far is Mars from earth?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Approximately forty million miles.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Well, that seems a safe enough distance.</p>
    <stage>OFF MIKE</stage> Thank you. <stage>PAUSE</stage>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, someone has just handed Professor Pierson a message.
        While he reads it, let me remind you that we are speaking to you from the observatory in
        Princeton, New Jersey, where we are interviewing the world- famous astronomer, Professor
        Pierson . . . One moment, please. Professor Pierson has passed me a message which he has
        just received . . . Professor, may I read the message to the listening audience?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Certainly, Mr. Phillips</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I shall read you a wire addressed to Professor Pierson from Dr. Gray of
        the National History Museum, New York. "9: 15 P.M. eastern standard time. Seismograph
        registered shock of almost earthquake intensity occurring within a radius of twenty miles of
        Princeton. Please investigate. Signed, Lloyd Gray, Chief of Astronomical Division" . . .
        Professor Pierson, could this occurrence possibly have something to do with the disturbances
        observed on the planet Mars?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Hardly, Mr. Phillips. This is probably a meteorite of unusual size and its arrival at this
        particular time is merely a coincidence. However, we shall conduct a search, as soon as
        daylight permits.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Thank you, Professor. Ladies and gentlemen, for the past ten minutes we've been speaking to
        you from the observatory at Princeton, bringing you a special interview with Professor
        Pierson, noted astronomer. This is Carl Phillips speaking. We are returning you now to our
        New York studio.</p>
    <stage>FADE IN PIANO PLAYING</stage>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, here is the latest bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News.
        Toronto, Canada: Professor Morse of McGill University reports observing a total of three
        explosions on the planet Mars, between the hours of 7: 45 P.M. and 9: 20 P.M., eastern
        standard time. This confirms earlier reports received from American observatories. Now,
        nearer home, comes a special announcement from Trenton, New Jersey. It is reported that at
        8: 50 P.M. a huge, flaming object, believed to be a meteorite, fell on a farm in the
        neighborhood of Grovers Mill, New Jersey, twenty-two miles from Trenton.</p>
    <p> The flash in the sky was visible within a radius of several hundred miles and the noise of
        the impact was heard as far north as Elizabeth.</p>
    <p> We have dispatched a special mobile unit to the scene, and will have our commentator, Carl
        Phillips, give you a word description as soon as he can reach there from Princeton. In the
        meantime, we take you to the Hotel Martinet in Brooklyn, where Bobby Millette and his
        orchestra are offering a program of dance music.</p>
    <stage>SWING BAND FOR TWENTY SECONDS . . . THEN CUT</stage>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>We take you now to Grovers Mill, New Jersey.</p>
    <stage>CROWD NOISES . . . POLICE SIRENS</stage>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Carl Phillips again, at the Wilmuth farm, Grovers Mill, New
        Jersey. Professor Pierson and myself made the eleven miles from Princeton in ten minutes.
        Well, I . . . I hardly know where to begin, to paint for you a word picture of the strange
        scene before my eyes, like something out of a modern "Arabian Nights." Well, I just got
        here. I haven't had a chance to look around yet. I guess that's it. Yes, I guess that's the
        . . . thing, directly in front of me, half buried in a vast pit. Must have struck with
        terrific force. The ground is covered with splinters of a tree it must have struck on its
        way down. What I can see of the . . . object itself doesn't look very much like a meteor, at
        least not the meteors I've seen. It looks more like a huge cylinder. It has a diameter of .
        . . what would you say, Professor Pierson?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <stage>OFF-MIKE</stage>
    <p>What's that?</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>What would you say . . . what is the diameter?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>About thirty yards.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>About thirty yards . . . The metal on the sheath is . . . well, I've never seen anything like
        it. The color is sort of yellowish-white. Curious spectators now are pressing close to the
        object in spite of the efforts of the police to keep them back. They're getting in front of
        my line of vision. Would you mind standing to one side, please?</p>
    <speaker>POLICEMAN</speaker>
    <p>One side, there, one side.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>While the policemen are pushing the crowd back, here's Mr. Wilmuth, owner of the farm here.
        He may have some interesting facts to add . . . Mr. Wilmuth, would you please tell the radio
        audience as much as you remember of this rather unusual visitor that dropped in your
        backyard? Step closer, please. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. Wilmuth.</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Well, I was listenin' to the radio.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Closer and louder please.</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Pardon me?!</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Louder, please, and closer.</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Yes, sir -- I was listening to the radio and kinda drowsin'. That Professor fellow was
        talkin' about Mars, so I was half dozin' and half . . .</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Yes, yes, Mr. Wilmuth. Then what happened?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>As I was sayin', I was listenin' to the radio kinda halfways . . .</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Yes, Mr. Wilmuth, and then you saw something?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Not first off. I heard something.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>And what did you hear?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>A hissing sound. Like this: SSSSSSS . . . kinda like a fourt' of July rocket.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Yes, then what?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Turned my head out the window and would have swore I was to sleep and dreamin.'</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Then what?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>I seen a kinda greenish streak and then zingo! Somethin' smacked the ground. Knocked me clear
        out of my chair!</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Well, were you frightened, Mr. Wilmuth?</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Well, I -- I ain't quite sure. I reckon I -- I was kinda riled.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Thank you, Mr. Wilmuth. Thank you.</p>
    <speaker>WILMUTH</speaker>
    <p>Want me to tell you some more?</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>No . . . That's quite all right, that's plenty.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you've just heard Mr. Wilmuth, owner of the farm where this thing has
        fallen. I wish I could convey the atmosphere . . . the background of this . . . fantastic
        scene. Hundreds of cars are parked in a field in back of us. Police are trying to rope off
        the roadway leading to the farm. But it's no use. They're breaking right through. Cars'
        headlights throw an enormous spot on the pit where the object's half buried. Some of the
        more daring souls are now venturing near the edge. Their silhouettes stand out against the
        metal sheen.</p>
    <stage>FAINT HUMMING SOUND</stage>
    <p> One man wants to touch the thing . . . he's having an argument with a policeman. The
        policeman wins. . . . Now, ladies and gentlemen, there's something I haven't mentioned in
        all this excitement, but now it's becoming more distinct. Perhaps you've caught it already
        on your radio. Listen:</p>
    <stage>LONG PAUSE</stage> . . . Do you hear it? It's a curious humming sound that seems to come
    from inside the object. I'll move the microphone nearer. <stage>PAUSE</stage> Now we're not more
    then twenty-five feet away. Can you hear it now? Oh, Professor Pierson!
        <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Yes, Mr. Phillips?</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Can you tell us the meaning of that scraping noise inside the thing?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Possibly the unequal cooling of its surface.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>I see, do you still think it's a meteor, Professor?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>I don't know what to think. The metal casing is definitely extraterrestrial . . . not found
        on this earth. Friction with the earth's atmosphere usually tears holes in a meteorite. This
        thing is smooth and, as you can see, of cylindrical shape.</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Just a minute! Something's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, this is terrific! This end of the
        thing is beginning to flake off! The top is beginning to rotate like a screw! The thing must
        be hollow!</p>
    <speaker>VOICES</speaker>
    <p>She's movin'! Look, the darn thing's unscrewing! Keep back, there! Keep back, I tell you!
        Maybe there's men in it trying to escape! It's red hot, they'll burn to a cinder! Keep back
        there. Keep those idiots back!</p>
    <stage>SUDDENLY THE CLANKING SOUND OF A HUGE PIECE OF FALLING METAL</stage>
    <speaker>VOICES</speaker>
    <p>She's off! The top's loose! Look out there! Stand back!</p>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have ever witnessed . . . Wait a
        minute! Someone's crawling out of the hollow top. Someone or . . . something. I can see
        peering out of that black hole two luminous disks . . are they eyes? It might be a face. It
        might be . . .</p>
    <stage>SHOUT OF AWE FROM THE CROWD</stage>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake. Now it's another
        one, and another. They look like tentacles to me. There, I can see the thing's body. It's
        large, large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather. But that face, it . . . Ladies and
        gentlemen, it's indescribable. I can hardly force myself to keep looking at it. The eyes are
        black and gleam like a serpent. The mouth is V-shaped with saliva dripping from its rimless
        lips that seem to quiver and pulsate. The monster or whatever it is can hardly move. It
        seems weighed down by . . . possibly gravity or something. The thing's raising up. The crowd
        falls back now. They've seen plenty. This is the most extraordinary experience. I can't find
        words . . . I'll pull this microphone with me as I talk. I'll have to stop the description
        until I can take a new position. Hold on, will you please, I'll be right back in a
        minute.</p>
    <stage>FADE INTO PIANO</stage>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker> We are bringing you an eyewitness account of what's happening on
    the Wilmuth farm, Grovers Mill, New Jersey. <stage>MORE PIANO</stage> We now return you to Carl
    Phillips at Grovers Mill. <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen (Am I on?). Ladies and gentlemen, here I am, back of a stone wall that
        adjoins Mr. Wilmuth's garden. From here I get a sweep of the whole scene. I'll give you
        every detail as long as I can talk. As long as I can see. More state police have arrived
        They're drawing up a cordon in front of the pit, about thirty of them. No need to push the
        crowd back now. They're willing to keep their distance. The captain is conferring with
        someone. We can't quite see who. Oh yes, I believe it's Professor Pierson. Yes, it is. Now
        they've parted. The Professor moves around one side, studying the object, while the captain
        and two policemen advance with something in their hands. I can see it now. It's a white
        handkerchief tied to a pole . . . a flag of truce. If those creatures know what that means .
        . . what anything means!. . . Wait! Something's happening!</p>
    <stage>HISSING SOUND FOLLOWED BY A HUMMING THAT INCREASES IN INTENSITY</stage>
    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker>
    <p>A humped shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam of light against a
        mirror. What's that? There's a jet of flame springing from the mirror, and it leaps right at
        the advancing men. It strikes them head on! Good Lord, they're turning into flame!</p>

    <speaker>PHILLIPS</speaker> Now the whole field's caught fire. <stage>EXPLOSION</stage> The

    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the
        broadcast from Grovers Mill. Evidently there's some difficulty with our field transmission.
        However, we will return to that point at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, we have
        a late bulletin from San Diego, California. Professor Indellkoffer, speaking at a dinner of
        the California Astronomical Society, expressed the opinion that the explosions on Mars are
        undoubtedly nothing more than severe volcanic disturbances on the surface of the planet. We
        now continue with our piano interlude.</p>

    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed a message that came in from Grovers Mill by
        telephone. Just a moment. At least forty people, including six state troopers lie dead in a
        field east of the village of Grovers Mill, their bodies burned and distorted beyond all
        possible recognition. The next voice you hear will be that of Brigadier General Montgomery
        Smith, commander of the state militia at Trenton, New Jersey.</p>
    <speaker>SMITH</speaker>
    <p>I have been requested by the governor of New Jersey to place the counties of Mercer and
        Middlesex as far west as Princeton, and east to Jamesburg, under martial law. No one will be
        permitted to enter this area except by special pass issued by state or military authorities.
        Four companies of state militia are proceeding from Trenton to Grovers Mill, and will aid in
        the evacuation of homes within the range of military operations. Thank you.</p>
    <p> ANNOUNCER TWO You have just been listening to General Montgomery Smith commanding the state
        militia at Trenton. In the meantime, further details of the catastrophe at Grovers Mill are
        coming in. The strange creatures after unleashing their deadly assault, crawled back into
        their pit and made no attempt to prevent the efforts of the firemen to recover the bodies
        and extinguish the fire. Combined fire departments of Mercer County are fighting the flames
        which menace the entire countryside. We have been unable to establish any contact with our
        mobile unit at Grovers Mill, but we hope to be able to return you there at the earliest

        information -- either as to their nature, their origin, or their purposes here on earth Of
        their destructive instrument I might venture some conjectural explanation. For want of a
        better term, I shall refer to the mysterious weapon as a heat ray. It's all too evident that
        these creatures have scientific knowledge far in advance of our own. It is my guess that in
        some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute
        nonconductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they
        choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the mirror
        of a lighthouse projects a beam of light. That is my conjecture of the origin of the heat
        ray . . .</p>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>Thank you, Professor Pierson. Ladies and gentlemen, here is a bulletin from Trenton. It is a
        brief statement informing us that the charred body of Carl Phillips has been identified in a
        Trenton hospital. Now here's another bulletin from Washington, D.C. Office of the director
        of the National Red Cross reports ten units of Red Cross emergency workers have been
        assigned to the headquarters of the state militia stationed outside Grovers Mill, New
        Jersey. Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction: The fires at Grovers Mill
        and vicinity are now under control. Scouts report all quiet in the pit, and no sign of life
        appearing from the mouth of the cylinder . . . And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a
        special statement from Mr. Harry McDonald, vice- president in charge of operations.</p>
    <speaker>MC DONALD</speaker>
    <p>We have received a request from the militia at Trenton to place at their disposal our entire
        broadcasting facilities. In view of the gravity of the situation, and believing that radio
        has a responsibility to serve in the public interest at all times, we are turning over our
        facilities to the state militia at Trenton.</p>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER TWO</speaker>
    <p>We take you now to the field headquarters of the state militia near Grovers Mill, New
        Jersey.</p>
    <speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
    <p>This is Captain Lansing of the signal corps, attached to the state militia now engaged in
        military operations in the vicinity of Grovers Mill. Situation arising from the reported
        presence of certain individuals of unidentified nature is now under complete control. The
        cylindrical object which lies in a pit directly below our position is surrounded on all
        sides by eight battalions of infantry. Without heavy field pieces, but adequately armed with
        rifles and machine guns. All cause for alarm, if such cause ever existed, is now entirely
        unjustified. The things, whatever they are, do not even venture to poke their heads above
        the pit. I can see their hiding place plainly in the glare of the searchlights here. With
        all their reported resources, these creatures can scarcely stand up against heavy
        machine-gun fire Anyway, it's an interesting outing for the troops. I can make out their
        khaki uniforms, crossing back and forth in front of the lights. It looks almost like a real
        war. There appears to be some slight smoke in the woods bordering the Millstone River.
        Probably fire started by campers. Well, we ought to see some action soon. One of the
        companies is deploying on the left flank. An quick thrust and it will all be over. Now wait
        a minute! I see something on top of the cylinder. No, it's nothing but a shadow. Now the
        troops are on the edge of the Wilmuth farm. Seven thousand armed men closing in on an old
        metal tube. Wait, that wasn't a shadow! It's something moving . . . solid metal . . . kind
        of shield-like affair rising up out of the cylinder . . . It's going higher and higher. Why,
        it's standing on legs . . . actually rearing up on a sort of metal framework. Now it's
        reaching above the trees and the searchlights are on it. Hold on!</p>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
    <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem, both
        the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption
        that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmlands tonight are the vanguard of an
        invading army from the planet Mars. The battle which took place tonight at Grovers Mill has
        ended in one of the most startling defeats ever suffered by any army in modern times; seven
        thousand men armed with rifles and machine guns pitted against a single fighting machine of
        the invaders from Mars. One hundred and twenty known survivors. The rest strewn over the
        battle area from Grovers Mill to Plainsboro, crushed and trampled to death under the metal
        feet of the monster, or burned to cinders by its heat ray. The monster is now in control of
        the middle section of New Jersey and has effectively cut the state through its center.
        Communication lines are down from Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean. Railroad tracks are
        torn and service from New York to Philadelphia discontinued except routing some of the
        trains through Allentown and Phoenixville. Highways to the north, south, and west are
        clogged with frantic human traffic. Police and army reserves are unable to control the mad
        flight. By morning the fugitives will have swelled Philadelphia, Camden, and Trenton, it is
        estimated, to twice their normal population. At this time martial law prevails throughout
        New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. We take you now to Washington for a special broadcast
        on the National Emergency . . . the Secretary of the Interior . . .</p>
    <speaker>SECRETARY</speaker>
    <p>Citizens of the nation: I shall not try to conceal the gravity of the situation that
        confronts the country, nor the concern of your government in protecting the lives and
        property of its people. However, I wish to impress upon you -- private citizens and public
        officials, all of you -- the urgent need of calm and resourceful action. Fortunately, this
        formidable enemy is still confined to a comparatively small area, and we may place our faith
        in the military forces to keep them there. In the meantime placing our faith in God we must
        continue the performance of our duties each and every one of us, so that we may confront
        this destructive adversary with a nation united, courageous, and consecrated to the
        preservation of human supremacy on this earth. I thank you.</p>
    <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
    <p>You have just heard the secretary of the Interior speaking from Washington. Bulletins too
        numerous to read are piling up in the studio here. We are informed the central portion of
        New Jersey is blacked out from radio communication due to the effect of the heat ray upon
        power lines and electrical equipment. Here is a special bulletin from New York. Cables
        received from English, French, German scientific bodies offering assistance. Astronomers
        report continued gas outbursts at regular intervals on planet Mars. Majority voice opinion
        that enemy will be reinforced by additional rocket machines. Attempts made to locate
        Professor Pierson of Princeton, who has observed Martians at close range. It is feared he
        was lost in recent battle. Langham field, Virginia: Scouting planes report three Martian
        machines visible above treetops, moving north towards Somerville with population fleeing
        ahead of them. Heat ray not in use; although advancing at express-train speed, invaders pick
        their way carefully. They seem to be making conscious effort to avoid destruction of cities
        and countryside. However, they stop to uproot power lines, bridges, and railroad tracks.
        Their apparent objective is to crush resistance, paralyze communication, and disorganize
        human society.</p>
    <p> Here is a bulletin from Basking Ridge, New Jersey: Coon hunters have stumbled on a second
        cylinder similar to the first embedded in the great swamp twenty miles south of Morristown.
        Army field pieces are proceeding from Newark to blow up second invading unit before cylinder
        can be opened and the fighting machine rigged. They are taking up position in the --
        foothills of Watchung Mountains. Another bulletin from Langham Field, Virginia: Scouting
        planes report enemy machines, now three in number, increasing speed northward kicking over
        houses and trees in their evident haste to form a conjunction with their allies south of
        Morristown. Machines also sighted by telephone operator east of Middlesex within ten miles
        of Plainfield. Here's a bulletin from Winston Field, Long Island: Fleet of army bombers
        carrying heavy explosives flying north in pursuit of enemy. Scouting planes act as guides.
        They keep speeding enemy in sight. Just a moment please. Ladies and gentlemen, we've run
        special wires to the artillery line in adjacent villages to give you direct reports in the
        zone of the advancing enemy. First we take you to the battery of the 22nd Field Artillery,
        located in the Watchtung Mountains.</p>

    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>As I set down these notes on paper, I'm obsessed by the thought that I may be the last living
        man on earth. I have been hiding in this empty house near Grovers Mill -- a small island of
        daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world. All that happened before the
        arrival of these monstrous creatures in the world now seems part of another life. . . a life
        that has no continuity with the present, furtive existence of the lonely derelict who
        pencils these words on the back of some astronomical notes bearing the signature of Richard
        Pierson. I look down at my blackened hands, my torn shoes, my tattered clothes, and I try to
        connect them with a professor who lives at Princeton, and who on the night of October 30,
        glimpsed through his telescope an orange splash of light on a distant planet. My wife, my
        colleagues, my students, my books, my observatory, my. . . my world. . . where are they? Did
        they ever exist? Am I Richard Pierson? What day is it? Do days exist without calendars? Does
        time pass when there are no human hands left to wind the clocks? . . .In writing down my
        daily life I tell myself I shall preserve human history between the dark covers of this
        little book that was meant to record the movements of the stars. . . But to write I must
        live, and to live, I must eat . . . I find moldy bread in the kitchen, and an orange not too
        spoiled to swallow. I keep watch at the window. From time to time I catch sight of a Martian
        above the black smoke. The smoke still holds the house in its black coil. . . but at length
        there is a hissing sound and suddenly I see a Martian mounted on his machine, spraying the
        air with a jet of steam, as if to dissipate the smoke. I watch in a corner as his huge metal
        legs nearly brush against the house. Exhausted by terror, I fall asleep. . .it's morning. .
        .</p>
    <stage>QUIETLY</stage> Morning! Sun streams in the window. The black cloud of gas has lifted,
    and the scorched meadows to the north look as though a black snowstorm has passed over them. I
    venture from the house. I make my way to a road. No traffic. Here and there a wrecked car,
    baggage overturned, a blackened skeleton. I push on north. For some reason I feel safer trailing
    these monsters than running away from them. And I keep a careful watch. I have seen the
    Martians. . . feed. Should one of their machines appear over the top of trees, I am ready to
    fling myself flat on the earth. I come to a chestnut tree. October chestnuts are ripe. I fill my
    pockets. I must keep alive. Two days I wander in a vague northerly direction through a desolate
    world. Finally I notice a living creature. . . a small red squirrel in a beech tree. I stare at
    him, and wonder. He stares back at me. I believe at that moment the animal and I shared the same
    emotion. . .the joy of finding another living being. I push on north. I find dead cows in a
    brackish field. Beyond, the charred ruins of a dairy. The silo remains standing guard over the
    waste land like a lighthouse deserted by the sea. Astride the silo perches a weathercock. The
    arrow points north. <p> Next day I came to a city vaguely familiar in its contours, yet its
        buildings strangely dwarfed and leveled off, as if a giant hand sliced off its highest
        towers with a capricious sweep of his hand. I reached the outskirts. I found Newark,
        undemolished, but humbled by some whim of the advancing Martians. Presently, with an odd
        feeling of being watched, I caught sight of something crouching in a doorway. I made a step
        towards it, and it rose up and bacame a man! -- a man, armed with a large knife.</p>

    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Have you seen any . . . Martians?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Naah. They've gone over to New York. At night the sky is alive with their lights. Just as if
        people were still livin' in it. By daylight you can't see them. Five days ago a couple of
        them carried somethin' big across the flats from the airport. I believe they're learning how
        to fly.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>

    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Where were you? You're in a uniform.</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Yeah, what's left of it. I was in the militia -- national guard. . . That's good! Wasn't any
        war any more than there's war between men and ants.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>And we're eat-able ants. I found that out. . . What will they do with us?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>I've thought it all out. Right now we're caught as we're wanted. The Martian only has to go a
        few miles to get a crowd on the run. But they won't keep doing that. They'll begin catching
        us systematic-like -- keeping the best and storing us in cages and things. They haven't
        begun on us yet!</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Not begun!</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Not begun! All that's happened so far is because we don't have sense enough to keep quiet. .
        . botherin' them with guns and such stuff and losing our heads and rushing off in crowds.
        Now instead of our rushing around blind we've got to fix ourselves up -- fix ourselves up
        according to the way things are NOW. Cities, nations, civilization, progress. . . done.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>But if that's so, what is there to live for?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Well, there won't be any more concerts for a million years or so, and no nice little dinners
        at restaurants. If it's amusement you're after, I guess the game's up.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>And what is there left?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Life. . . that's what! I want to live. Yeah, and so do you. We're not going to be
        exterminated. And I don't mean to be caught, either, and tamed, and fattened, and bred, like
        an ox.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>What are you going to do?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>I'm going on. . . right under their feet. I got a plan. We men as men are finished. We don't
        know enough. We gotta learn plenty before we've got a chance. And we've got to live and keep
        free while we learn, see? I've thought it all out, see.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Tell me the rest.</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Well, it isn't all of us that were made for wild beasts, and that's what it's got to be.
        That's why I watched YOU. All these little office workers that used to live in these houses
        -- they'd be no good. They haven't any stuff to 'em. They just used to run off to work. I've
        seen hundreds of 'em, running wild to catch their commuter train in the morning for fear
        they'd get canned if they didn't; running back at night afraid they won't be in time for
        dinner. Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents. And on Sundays, worried
        about the hereafter. The Martians will be a godsend for those guys. Nice roomy cages, good
        food, careful breeding, no worries. After a week or so chasing about the fields on empty
        stomachs they'll come and be glad to be caught.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>You've thought it all out, haven't you?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>You bet I have! And that isn't all. These Martians will make pets of some of 'em, train 'em
        to do tricks. Who knows? Get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.
        . . And some, maybe, they'll train to hunt us.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>No, that's impossible. No human being. . .</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Yes they will. There's men who'll do it gladly. If one of them ever comes after me, why. .
        .</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>In the meantime, you and I and others like us. . . where are we to live when the Martians own
        the earth?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>I've got it all figured out. We'll live underground. I've been thinking about the sewers.
        Under New York are miles and miles of 'em. The main ones are big enough for anybody. Then
        there's cellars, vaults, underground storerooms, railway tunnels, subways. You begin to see,
        eh? And we'll get a bunch of strong men together. No weak ones; that rubbish -- out.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>And you meant me to go?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>Well, I gave you a chance, didn't I?</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>We won't quarrel about that. Go on.</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>And we've got to make safe places for us to stay in, see, and get all the books we can --
        science books. That's where men like you come in, see? We'll raid the museums, we'll even
        spy on the Martians. It may not be so much we have to learn before -- just imagine this:
        four or five of their own fighting machines suddenly start off -- heat rays right and left
        and not a Martian in 'em. Not a Martian in 'em! But MEN -- men who have learned the way how.
        It may even be in our time. Gee! Imagine having one of them lovely things with it's heat ray
        wide and free! We'd turn it on Martians, we'd turn it on men. We'd bring everybody down to
        their knees.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>That's your plan?</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <p>You, and me, and a few more of us we'd own the world.</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>I see. . .</p>
    <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
    <stage>FADING OUT</stage> Say, what's the matter? . . . Where are you going?
        <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>Not to your world. . . Goodbye, stranger. . .</p>
    <speaker>PIERSON</speaker>
    <p>After parting with the artilleryman, I came at last to the Holland Tunnel. I entered that
        silent tube anxious to know the fate of the great city on the other side of the Hudson.
        Cautiously I came out of the tunnel and made my way up Canal Street. I reached Fourteenth
        Street, and there again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil ominous smell from
        the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses. I wandered up through the Thirties and
        Forties; I stood alone on Times Square. I caught sight of a lean dog running down Seventh
        Avenue with a piece of dark brown meat in his jaws, and a pack of starving mongrels at his
        heels. He made a wide circle around me, as though he feared I might prove a fresh
        competitor. I walked up Broadway in the direction of that strange powder -- past silent
        shopwindows, displaying their mute wares to empty sidewalks -- past the Capitol Theatre,
        silent, dark -- past a shooting gallery, where a row of empty guns faced an arrested line of
        wooden ducks. Near Columbus Circle I noticed models of 1939 motorcars in the showrooms
        facing empty streets. From over the top of the General Motors Building, I watched a flock of
        black birds circling in the sky. I hurried on. Suddenly I caught sight of the hood of a
        Martian machine, standing somewhere in Central Park, gleaming in the late afternoon sun. An
        insane idea! I rushed recklessly across Columbus Circle and into the Park. I climbed a small
        hill above the pond at Sixtieth Street. From there I could see, standing in a silent row
        along the mall, nineteen of those great metal Titans, their cowls empty, their great steel
        arms hanging listlessly by their sides. I looked in vain for the monsters that inhabit those
        machines.</p>
    <p> Suddenly, my eyes were attracted to the immense flock of black birds that hovered directly
        below me. They circled to the ground, and there before my eyes, stark and silent, lay the
        Martians, with the hungry birds pecking and tearing brown shreds of flesh from their dead
        bodies. Later when their bodies were examined in the laboratories, it was found that they
        were killed by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were
        unprepared. . . slain, after all man's defenses had failed, by the humblest thing that God
        in His wisdom put upon this earth.</p>
    <p> Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space
        no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. Dim and
        wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this
        little seedbed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But
        that is a remote dream. It may be that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve.
        To them, and not to us, is the future ordained perhaps.</p>
    <p> Strange it now seems to sit in my peaceful study at Princeton writing down this last chapter
        of the record begun at a deserted farm in Grovers Mill. Strange to see from my window the
        university spires dim and blue through an April haze. Strange to watch children playing in
        the streets. Strange to see young people strolling on the green, where the new spring grass
        heals the last black scars of a bruised earth. Strange to watch the sightseers enter the
        museum where the dissembled parts of a Martian machine are kept on public view. Strange when
        I recall the time when I first saw it, bright and clean-cut, hard, and silent, under the
        dawn of that last great day.</p>
    <stage>MUSIC SWELLS UP AND OUT</stage>
    <speaker>ORSON WELLES</speaker>
    <p>This is Orson Welles, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that The War of
        The Worlds has no further significance than as the holiday offering it was intended to be.
        The Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush
        and saying Boo! Starting now, we couldn't soap all your windows and steal all your garden
        gates by tomorrow night. . . so we did the best next thing. We annihilated the world before
        your very ears, and utterly destroyed the C. B. S. You will be relieved, I hope, to learn
        that we didn't mean it, and that both institutions are still open for business. So goodbye
        everybody, and remember the terrible lesson you learned tonight. That grinning, glowing,
        globular invader of your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch, and if your
        doorbell rings and nobody's there, that was no Martian. . .it's Hallowe'en.</p>
