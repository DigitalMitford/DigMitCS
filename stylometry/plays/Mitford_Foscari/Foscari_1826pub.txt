               SCENE I.
               
                  St. Mark's Place.
               
                  Count ErizzoandCelso meeting Donato.
               
                  Don.
                  Good morrowCount Erizzo, you are early. 
                  Are you bound to the Palace?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Aye, Donato,
                  The common destination; but I go
                  With an old friend.
               
               
                  Don.
                  What, Celso, thou turned courtier!
               
               
                  Cel.
                  I am a suitor to his Highness, Sir, 
                  With Count Erizzo's aid.
               
               
                  Don.
                  What is your suit?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  One of the procuratorsThe Procurator of St. Mark's was the second-most prestigious lifetime office in the Republic of Venice (the most prestigious was that of the Doge). died last night;
                  And honest Celsohere would fain succeed
                  To that good office.
               
               
                  Don.
                  None more capable!
                  You will not fail.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Scarcely, I think;---and yet
                  I hardly know. The old Doge likes me not:
                  There have been murmurs in the Senate, cousin,
                  At these long wasting wars; and he, I hear,
                  Suspects me. I have doubts. From you, indeed,
                  One word--
               
               
                  Don.
                  It shall be said. Give me the paper.
                  Yes, at one word from me---theDoge and I
                  Are friends, old friends, the friends of forty years;
                  Besides we have a pair of hopeful sons,
                  Friends from the cradle upwards.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  And those friends
                  May soon be brothers. Will not thy Camilla
                  
                  Be Foscari's bride, when his rough mistress War
                  Shall loose him from her arms?
               
               
                  Don.
                  Aye; he'll return
                  Too soon,, whene'er he comes, to steal away
                  My age's darling. Yet is he a boy
                  Full of high thoughts, a noble princely boy,
                  Kindly and generous; one that may deserve
                  Even her.---Well, give me this petition,Count.
                  Look on the post as certain.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  How can I
                  Repay---He's gone. Think'st thou he will succeed?
                  
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I know not. Either way works well for us.
                  If he succeed, then will our party gain
                   firmer foot in Venice; if he fail,
                  We gain Donato.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Say'st thou so?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I know him.
                  He's of a temper kind, and quick, and warm;
                  A powerful partizan, but easily sway'd
                  By flattery or anger. Of such tools
                  Are Faction's ranks composed, not officered.
                  
                     Celso, we'll have this Dogeunbonneted,
                  This Doge who wears his load of four-score years
                  Easier than I my forty. He contemns
                  Me and my brother nobles: he may learn
                  To know and fear our power. I tell you, Sir,
                  These brows of mine do ache for that same bonnet,
                  
                  And ere this day be ended---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  'Tis, my Lord,
                  A golden moment. The young Foscari
                  
                  Is safe with Sforza in the Milan wars.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Would I were sure of that! This is indeed
                  The only moment. Celso, I have here,
                  How intercepted boots not, letters from
                  
                     Both generals to the Senate. They have gained
                  A signal victory; Brescia is freed;
                  And Sforza gives the unshared unmingled praise
                  To Foscari. We must unthrone the Doge
                  
                  Ere this news reach the citycity; for the people
                  Adore the Foscari. Faugh! I am weary
                  Of this good Doge, this venerable Doge,
                  This popular Doge, this Doge who courts and
                        wooes
                        woos
                     
                  
                  The noisy rabble, whilst the Senators
                  
                  He elbows from their seats. And for the son,
                  With his hot 
                        valour
                        valor
                     and proud lack of pride---
                  I hate them both. We must not lose an hour---
                  The people must not hear---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  The Senate hates them.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Aye, but the Senate---
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Well, my Lord, the Senate--
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Fy! I am one of them; I must not tell
                  The secrets of the Council. We are not
                  So stubborn as we seem; the popular voice
                  Finds there an echo; and besides the Doge
                  
                  Hath friends. Here comes one.
                  Enter Count Zeno.
                  A fair morning to you
                  
                     Count Zeno. I have scarcely seen you since
                  Your lingering sickness.You look cheerily.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  The air of this new day is sweet and freshening,
                  And breathes a health into the veins. I trust
                  You need no renovating; yet to step
                  From a sick bed and a dark silent room
                  Into the pure and balmy air of June,
                  With the bright sunlighting so blue a sky,
                  And sparkling on the waterswaters all around,
                  Full of the living noise of trade or mirth,
                  Air, earth, and sea all motion---it is like
                  Returning from the tomb to this fair world
                  Of life and sunshine! Such delight is well
                  Worth a sharp fever.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Nevertheless am I
                  Content with your report. A homelier joy
                  Suffices me.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  You are the happier man.
                  Are you for the palace?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No. We wait a friend.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then I must say good morrow. I am somewhat
                  In haste to-day.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Good morrow,Count.
                  Exit Zeno.
                  That man
                  Wears in his courtly smile the consciousness
                  Of his high influence---the prime 
                        favourite
                        favorite
                      he!
                  Did you not see how graciously he stooped
                  To me his equal, even as he had been
                  Himself a prince---proud minion!---Doge, beware!
                  Beware!--- Look, look, Donato too hath found
                  A check?See how he chafes! See!
               
               Enter Donato.
               
                  Don.
                  Take thy paper!
                  I am refused. Good morrow!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Nay, come back.
                  Can this be possible? Refused! Donato
                  
                  Refused by Foscari!
               
               
                  Don.
                  I was a fool
                  To ask;---a double fool to pin my faith
                  Upon this Doge's ermine.
               
               
                  Celso.
                  I regret
                  More than my failure the indignity---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Forget it, Sir.---How go these Milanwars?---
                  I say, Erizzo, could'st thou have believed
                  The proudest he in Venice would have dared
                  To treat me with such scorn?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What! did he scorn thee?
               
               
                  Don.
                  He chid me, schooled me, blamed my easy temper,
                  That lent an ear to every cunning tale,
                  A voice to every false designing knave.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Dared he!
               
               
                  Don.
                  And this to me! Why art thou not
                  Amazed,Erizzo?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No. It but confirms
                  What I have heard and scarce believed. The Doge
                  
                  Is grown so old that he forgets his friends.
                  Men say---it can't be true---and yet men say---
               
               
                  Don.
                  What?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  That the Doge repents his son's betrothment
                  To thy Camilla.
               
               
                  Don.
                  He shall never wed her.
                  Sir, if this Doge were king of all the earth
                  He might have found a higher, prouder title
                  In father to Camilla! They are free.
                  
                     Camilla's claims shall never interrupt---
                  What is his project?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Our great enemy,
                   The Duke of Milan, hath a young, fair daughter,
                  And she, they say---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Tush! I have seen her, man!
                  A dark browed wench, a beetle-browed,---no more
                  To match with my Camilla than that Gondola
                  With the Bucentaur!The Bucentaur was a large, stately barge used by the Doge of Venice when performing the annual Marriage of the Sea ceremony. A gondola, by contrast, is a small flat-bottomed Venetian boat.---I will backand tell him
                  That Foscari
                      is free. Mine own Camilla!
                  My prattling, pretty one! I'll back and tell him.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  No; rather come with me. What I have said
                  Is hearsay or conjecture; what is true
                  Is the misgovernment, the public wrongs
                  Of this old Foscari, too old to sway
                  The power of Venice. This is not a place
                  For such discourse. Come with me to my palace.
               
               
                  Don.
                  I thought he loved my daughter!
               
               
                  Cel.
                   Thou art sure.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               An Apartment in the Ducal Palace.
               The DogeandCount Zeno.
               
                  Zeno.
                  Good morrow to your Highness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Dearest Zeno,
                  This is no common pleasure. Thou the latest
                  Of our late revellers, whom the sun scarce sees
                  Till half his course be run---
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Oh! good my Lord,
                  I meet him often ere I go to bed,
                  The bright reproachful tell-tale!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  To see thee,
                  But lately risen from a sharp sickness too,
                  Afoot so early! There must be some cause,
                  Some kind or pleasant cause---What brings thee,Count?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  This letter!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No petition for the post
                  Vacant by poor Venoni's death?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Oh!no.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I should have grieved within one little hour
                  To say twice No to two dear friends. You met
                  
                     Donato?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yes, so chafed he saw me not.
                  Your Highness knows his temper.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  And I fear
                  Tried it too much. He asked of me that office
                  For a known villain, an unusual compound
                  Of ruffian and of knave, the follower
                  Of his kinsmankinsman Count Erizzo.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then the Count
                  
                  Was waiting for Donato. I am grieved
                  He should be so companioned.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He flung from me
                  Ere I could tell him that the post was given
                  To Signor Loredano, a ripe scholar
                  Pining in penury, at the pressing instance
                  Of his own son.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  
                     Cosmmo! How like is that
                  To his unwearied kindness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  There is not,
                  Unless I may except my Foscari,
                  A youth in Venice who can vie in aught
                  With Cosmo.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And they are as different
                  As the bright sun and and gentle moon, the sea
                  In sparkling motion and the quiet land.
                  The one a stirring,braveand honest soldier,
                  The other a pale student.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Bless them both
                  
                  My noble boys! They have always loved like brothers,
                  And soon I hope my pretty sweet Camilla
                  
                  Will give them that dear title.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Have you had
                  Tidings of Foscari lately?
               
               
                  Dage.
                  Not for long,
                  Longer than common.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Last night at St. Mark's
                  There was a rumour floating--none could trace
                  Its source---of a great victory obtained
                  By Foscari and Sforza.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Heaven grant it!
                  
                  Sure we shall hear to day.--Now dearest Count, 
                  What is your will? You led the old man on
                  To talk of his dear children, till in sooth
                  He had forgotten the whole world. Now say
                  What is that scroll?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My lord---I almost fear---
                  Dost thou believe in soothsayers?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No!--Yes!--
                  Not much.Why dost thou ask?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Wilt thou not answer?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  
                     Count Zeno, thou art one to whom, being wise,
                  A wise man may confess the cherished folly
                  That lurks within his breast. But tell it not
                  To fools, good Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Then thou dost believe?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I have some cause. What! didst thou never hear
                  Of the old prediction that was verified
                  When I became the Doge?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  An old prediction!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Some seventy years ago--it seems to me
                  As fresh as yesterday--being then a lad
                  No higher than my hand, idle as an heir,
                  And all made up of gay and truant sports,
                  I flew a kite unmatched in shape or size
                  Over the river--we were at our house
                  
                  Upon the Brenta then; it soared aloft
                  Driven by light vigorous breezes from the sea,
                  Soared buoyantly, till the diminished toy
                  Grew smaller than the falcon when she stoops
                  To dart upon her prey. I sent for cord,
                  Servant on servanthurrying, till the kite
                  Shrank to the size of a beetle: still I called
                  For cord, andand sent to summon father, mother,
                  My little sisters, my old halting nurse,--
                  I would have had the whole world to survey
                  Me and my wondrous kite. It still soared on,
                  And I stood bending back in extasy,
                  My eyes on that small point, clapping my hands,
                  And shouting, and half envying it the flight
                  That made it a companion of the stars,
                  When close beside me a deep voice exclaimed--
                  Aye, mount! mount! mount!--I started back, and saw
                  A tall and aged woman, one of the wild
                  Peculiar people whom wild Hungary sends
                  Roving through every land. She drew her cloak
                  About her, turned her black eyes up to Heaven,
                  And thus pursued:--Aye, like his fortunes,mount,
                  The future Doge of Venice! And before
                  For very wonder any one could speak
                  She disappeared.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Strange! Hast thou never seen
                  That woman since?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I never saw her more.
                  After a slight brief search, the wonder sank
                  Into a jest. My mother for a while
                  Called me her pretty Doge, her madcap Doge,
                  And rang a thousand fondling changes through
                  On that proud title; and my sisters long
                  Talked of the tall Hungarian. None believed
                  But my old nurse.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Long time in me
                  The seeds of faith lay dormant; till at last
                  As youth's gay wildness sobered, and ambition
                  Grew stronger in my soul, the prophecy
                  Knocked at my thoughts, and I by fits believed
                  That which I wished were true. Now for thy scroll;--
                  Whence comes it?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Even such an aged crone,
                  So tall, so habited, stayed me last night
                  At my own door, and with an earnest voice,
                  Her shaking hand prest on my arm, implored
                  That, as I loved the good Doge Foscari,
                  I would at his first waking give him this.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  She must be dead! Full seventy years ago--
                  And then her locks were grizzled!--She is dead.
                  And what, at fourscore years, have I to do
                  With fate or fortune! My long race is run.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Read it at least.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  (reads.)
                  
                     "The ducal bonnet trembles on thy brow, Doge of Venice,trembles--and will fall, though the stars themselves shew me not when. Grant the first boon that shall be asked of thee to-morrow, or before the next sun rises thy very heart shall be rent in twain."
                  
                  Grant the first boon! Why, my good Signor Celso,
                  This is too palpable. Grant the first boon!
                  Make thee the Procurator! Fy! Fy! Fy!
                  
                     Erizzo's talent hath forsaken him;
                  This cheat is shallow. They have heard the tale
                  I told thee, and this paltry poor device--
                  Off to the waves and winds!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yet hath the count
                  
                  A party in the state; and for Donato,
                  Kind, hasty, generous and beloved, his power
                  May vie with thine.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  But never will be used
                  Against me,Zeno. I should hate myself
                  Could I suspect Donato. Count,we'll go
                  Together to the Senate. Thou shalt see 
                  The quick relenting of his sudden wrath,
                  His graceful self-rebuke, his honest love.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  I'll gladly be converted.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Doubt him not.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE III.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               
               
                  CamillaandLaura.
               
                  Camilla.
                  
                     Laura, hast thou seen Cosmo?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Not .
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Sure he'll not cheat us of his early smiles,
                  His gay good-morrow, that best joy of home
                  When dear friends meet in morning cheerfulness.
               
               
                  Lau.
                  And such a cheerfulness! and such a smile!
                  None are like his.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  None! Hast thou never seen
                  The heaven of kindness that in Foscari's eyes
                  Shines under those dark brows? And I'm the sister
                  Of that dear Cosmo, the selected bride
                  Of that still dearer Foscari! Oh, cousin
                  I am the blessedest creature that e'er trod
                  This laughing earth! There is but only one
                  Can hope to be so happy;--thou, perchance
                  When Cosmo--
                  Enter Cosmo.
                  We were speaking of thee.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Well,
                  I trust fair maids. My gentle lady Laura,
                  Say yes to that.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Feed not man's vanity;
                  Let not thy blushes answer.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Sister mine,
                  'Tis thou art clothed in blushes. Why the dawn
                  Opening her ardent eyes, and shaking wide
                  Her golden locks on the Adriatic wave,
                  The bright Aurora, she is sad and pale
                  And spiritless compared to thee. Hast thou
                  Been Psyche's errand?An allusion to the four tasks imposed upon the mythological Psyche by her lover Cupid's mother, Venus, in Lucius Apuleius' Metamorphoses.Or hath some fair vision
                  Lapt thee in loveliness?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  I think I dreamt
                  Of heaven; for I was in a place where care
                  And fear and sorrowcame not, self-sustained

                  To the Seraphim, andsinging like a bird
                  From the deep gladness of a merry heart
                  The whole night long. And when the morning came
                  And I awakened in this work-day world,
                  The spell was on me still; and still is on
                  The buoyancy, the joy, the certain hope
                  Of happiness. Brother, are there no news
                  
                  Of Foscari?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  None certain. Yet is there
                  A balmyness of hope; and stirring rumours
                  Come pattering round us, with a pleasant sound,
                  Like the large drops before a summer shower.
                  They talk of Foscari and victory--
               
               
                  Cam.
                  There hath then been a battle. Is he safe?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  As safe as I myself.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Fy! what a fool
                  Am I to tremble so! And art thou sure?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  There is no certainty, but such a hope
                  As is her forerunner. Hath not my father
                  Heard of this victory?
               
               
                  Lau.
                  He hath been long 
                  Gone to the palace, and wished you to follow.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Gladly. I have a good man's gratitude
                  To pay to the good Doge. I must away
                  Or I shall miss the Senate.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Thou wilt send
                  The tidings,Cosmo?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Surely.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Quickly?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Good tidings,Cosmo.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes. My pretty cousin
                  Hast thou no charge to give?
               
               
                  Lau.
                  Why bring this tale,
                  This happy tale thyself.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Aye come thyself
                  Dear Cosmo, and farewell.
                  Exit Cosmo.
                  NowLauramine
                  Let us to the high balcony. I need
                  Fresh air and sun and sparkling sights and sounds
                  To help sustain this happiness, this hope,
                  Which weighs almost like fear. My dearest, come.
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF ACT THE FIRST
            
         
         
            ACT II.
            
               SCENE I.
               
                  The Senate.
               
                  Count Erizzo, Donato andSenators.
               
                  Eriz.
                  He rules us as a king--this Foscari,
                  An absolute king,haughty and imbecile
                  As any Eastern sovereign! He degrades
                  The old Nobility, contemns the Senate,
                  And cringes to the people--a mob courtier!
                  A greedy swallower of popular praise!
               
               
                  Sen.
                  He hates the Nobles.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  But this very day
                  Did he refuse to my dear kinsman here
                  A post, that he requested for a man
                  Who long hath served the state.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Refuse Donato!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Even so. He is of the Senate, is the head
                  Of an old powerful house, is rich, is noble,
                  Is nobly loved. Are not these crimes enough
                  To stir our Doge's wrath?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No more of this!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Then his misgovernment, his tedious wars,
                  His waste of blood and treasure, that his son,
                  That idol of the soldiery, may glut
                  His lust of glorious battle! Senators,
                  Why should we thus submit to what we hate?
                  Why bow to whom we made? The Doge is now
                  Too old for his high office. Good my lords,
                  Let us resume our power. Is there no brow
                  In Venice that may bear this ducal crown
                  Save one? Will it not sit as gracefully
                  On vigorous manhood's clustering curls? On thine,
                  
                     Donato? Or, Pisani, upon thine?
                  Or any man of us? Lords, have ye changed
                  Your purpose? That the Doge may be deposed
                  Is the fixed law of Venice. Are ye firm?
                  This is the moment.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  He must be unthroned.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Then be it done to-day.
               
               
                  2nd Sen.
                  I'll join thee,Count.
               
               
                  3rd Sen.
                  And I.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  
                     Donato, thou wilt best propose--
               
               
                  Don.
                  Oh no! He hath been harsh--but I have loved him--
                  We are old friends.
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Do it thyself,Erizzo.
               
               
                  Don.
                  But gently, reverently.
                  Enter Doge, Count Zeno,and other
								Senators.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My gracious lords
                  
                  I greet ye well!We are no truants, sirs,
                  This full assemblage honours our fair Venice,
                  Honours her senators.Signor Donato--
                  Nay shun me not--That post was promised to--
                  Thou wilt not hear! I have too often borne
                  With thy infirmity. Forget not, sir,
                  That thou'rt my friend, or I must needs remember
                  That I'm thy prince. Now to our business, lords.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Are there no letters from the army?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  None.
                  But there is through the city a loud bruit
                  Of victory.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  In a well ordered state
                  There is no pause for rumour; certainty
                  Outspeeds her lying rival.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Think'st thou, count,
                  That my old heart is quiet in this pause?
                  Thou hast no boy in yonder battle field,
                  Or thou would'st know how thirstily the soul
                  Of a father pants in his suspense for truth,
                  One single drop of sweet or bitter truth.
                  Enter Cosmo.
                  Who's that?
               
               
                  Sen.
                  
                     Cosmo Donato, please you, Sir.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh our young Secretary! Sit by me,
                  I had just missed thee,Cosmo. Was thy friend
                  Content?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Oh never gratitude was clothed
                  In such pure joy. I would your Highness saw
                  The happiness you caused.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Hush! Count Erizzo,
                  You were about to speak.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  I was;and yet
                  I gladly would delay, gladly resign
                  A painful duty.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  If it touch me, Sir,
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Is there not,my lord, a law in Venice,
                  That if the Doge, by sickness, grief, or age,
                  Become incapable, he be removed?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  There is. Say on.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What need I to say more!
                  Know we not all the good Doge Foscari
                  
                  Is turned of fourscore years? Fitter for him
                  To lay down the proud bonnet, which doth weigh
                  So heavily on those white hairs, and pass
                  In calm serene repose the evening hours
                  Of his unsullied life. So shall his sun,
                  Setting in tranquil beauty, leave a train
                  Of pure and cloudless light; so praised and loved
                  Shall he sink down to rest.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  This is not all.
                  On, on, my lord!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Fitter for us a man
                  Who shall remember in this state of Venice
                  
                  There is another power great as himself,
                  And greater than the people. Howsoe'er
                  Thou hast the bearing, Doge, of a born prince,--
                  To us thy subjects, thou art but the head
                  Of the Venetian nobles. Thy proud rank
                  Was given by them, thy equals. Each great name
                  That now surrounds thee hath in turn adorned
                  Thy splendid office. Not a noble house
                  But is a link in the resplendent chain
                  Of old Venetian story. We are born
                  Lords of the Adriatic; not a name
                  But hath been vowed her spouse. Think not such namessuch names
                  Are common sounds; they have a music in them,
                  An odorous recollection, they are part
                  Of the old glorious past. Their country knows
                  And loves the lofty echo which gives back
                  The memory of the buried great; and we
                  Their sons--Oh our own names are watchwords to us
                  That call to valour and to victory,
                  To goodnessand to freedom. This hast thou
                  Forgotten. Every creeping artisan,
                  Every hard-handed smoky slave is nearer
                  To our great Doge than we:to them all smiles
                  And princely graciousness--to us all frowns
                  And kingly pride. Fitter for us a Doge
                  Of a congenial spirit, to preside
                  Over our councils, and to guard and guide
                  The Senateand the State.
                  
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Perhaps Erizzo 
                  Would deign to wear this care-encompassed crown? 
                  Fy! Fy!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  My voice is for Donato, Sir!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My father Doge of Venice? Never! Never! 
                  He will not, must not, shall not. All the world 
                  Would join in one reproach; the very stones 
                  Of Venice would cry out; and we, his children--- 
                  Oh we should die of grief and shame! What he 
                  Supplant his friend, his dearest friend? Oh never! 
                  Father, thou wilt not?
               
               
                  Sen.
                  Silence!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Signor Cosmo 
                  Thou art not yet a Senator.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My lords, 
                  I pray your pardon; but if I had seen 
                  A venomed serpent coiling round his limbs 
                  And pressing him within its deadly clasp, 
                  Would ye have blamed the cry that Nature sent?--- 
                  Thou wilt not be the Doge?
               
               
                  Don.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  My father 
                  Forgive me that I feared. How could I fear! 
                  Forgive me.
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Noble boy!---Hast thou said all? 
                  That I am old, and that I love the people?
                  
                  Are these my crimes? Oh I am doubly guilty! 
                  I love them all, even ye that love me not! 
                  I cannot chuse but love ye, for ye are 
                  Venetians, quick, and proud, and sparkling eyed, 
                  Venetians, brave and free. Ye are the lords 
                  Of the bright sea-built city, beautiful 
                  As storied Athens; or the gorgeous pride 
                  Of Rome, eternal Rome; greater than kings 
                  Are ye Venetian nobles---ye are free; 
                  And that is greatness and nobility, 
                  The source and end of power. That I have made 
                  Liberty common as the common air, 
                  The sun-light, or the rippling waves that wash 
                  Our walls; that every citizen hath been 
                  Free as a Senator; that I have ruled 
                  In our fair Venice, as a father rules 
                  In his dear household, nothing intermitting 
                  Of needful discipline, but quenching fear 
                  In an indulgent kindness; these ye call 
                  My crimes. They are my boasts. Yes, I do love 
                  The honest artizans; there's not a face 
                  That smiles up at me with a kindly eye 
                  But sends a warmth into my heart, a glow 
                   Of buoyant youthfulness. Age doth not freeze 
                  Our human sympathies; the sap fails not 
                  Although the trunk be rugged. Age can feel, 
                  And think, and act. Oh noble Senators, 
                  Ye do mistake my crime. I am too young; 
                  I am not like to die; and they who wait 
                  Wax weary for my seat. I do not dote, 
                  My lord Erizzo; Yet--- 
                  Shouts without.)
                  Foscari! Foscari!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  What mean those shouts?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Francesco Foscari!
                  
                  There lives no other, whom a grateful people 
                  Would greet as with one heart.
                  Enter Foscari.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My Lord Francesco!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son, my very son! Now I am young 
                  And great and happy! Now I reign again, 
                  My noblest son!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Father! Why this is joy 
                  Deeper than victory! Dost feel my heart?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Art thou unhurt?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Untouched. I almost shame 
                  To want one glorious scar. How well he is! 
                  What fire is in his eyes! Cosmo, thou too!--- 
                  But I have tidings that the Doge must hear 
                  Upon his throne. High tidings, gracious lords! 
                   My father,---take thy state.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (aside)
                  Lost! lost! All lost! 
                  Another hour and that most hated boy 
                  Had been most welcome!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  (to Cosmo)
                  Still as lovely, Cosmo? 
                  And still as true?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes! Yes!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Will not the Doge 
                  Assume the accustomed seat?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son, these lords, 
                  These Senators, these mighty ones of Venice 
                  Have found thy father old. Hadst thou returned 
                  Some half hour later, thou hadst seen the throne 
                  Filled by Donato, or his cousin Count. 
                  Which hath thy voice, Francesco?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Thou not Doge! 
                  Erizzo climb into thy honoured seat, 
                  Honoured by thee! Or thou, Donato, thou
                  
                  Join with this false, ungrateful, heartless senate, 
                  This shadow and this mockery of wisdom, 
                  To cast aside the best and truest heart 
                  That ever made our Venice rich and proud 
                  And great and happy, to throw off thy Prince 
                  Like an old garment! Shame! Thou that didst call 
                  Thyself his friend! Shame! shame! My dearest Cosmo, 
                   This was a grief to thee. Oh shame! shame! shame!
               
               
                  Don.
                  Rated again, and by a boy! I tell thee 
                  I would not be the Doge.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  My Lord Francesco, 
                  Thy tidings.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Take thy state, Doge Foscari. 
                  From thee did I receive my maiden sword, 
                  From thee my high commission; to none other 
                  Will I resign them. Senators of Venice! 
                  Ingrates! I bring ye victory and peace. 
                  Victorious peace! Brescia is free, and Milan 
                  Sues at your feet for peace. Her haughty Duke 
                  Is Sforza's prisoner,---my prisoner, Doge, 
                  And Sforza weds his heir.
               
               
                  Don.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  (giving letters to the Doge)
                  Eight days hence 
                  He will be here. See what he writes, my lord. 
                  The Senate is amazed; yet from the field 
                  We sent ye somewhat of this glorious tale.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Those letters reached not Venice.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Count Erizzo, 
                  I met the messenger, and staid my horse 
                  To ask him of my father. He had stopt 
                  Short of the palace, but had safely given 
                  The packet to a Senator. Erizzo, 
                   Thou wast the man. Look at him, ye that ever 
                  Saw guilt ooze out in shame! Nay, tremble not;
                  
                  I pardon thee. There is no other vengeance 
                  For low dishonour. It would stain my sword 
                  To dip it in thy blood.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  My Lord Francesco, 
                  I yet may find a time---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I pardon thee.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Sforza says here, this Brescian victory 
                  Was gained by thee. Zeno, read there---just there.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Here is the treaty, Doge; already signed 
                  By Milan, Sforza, and myself: add thou 
                  Thy venerable name, Doge Foscari. 
                  So---having crowned a long and glorious reign 
                  With glorious peace, let me, thy son, pluck off 
                  This envied bonnet from thy honoured head. 
                  Wear it the worthiest! Never will it clip 
                  Within its golden circlet such high thoughts, 
                  Such a brave love of freedom, such a warm 
                  And generous faith in man. Proud lords of Venice, 
                  Ye ne'er deserved him. My good sword, lie there! 
                  I am no more your general. Pass we forth 
                  Together, my dear Father, private men--- 
                  Rich in the only wealth the world can give, 
                  A spotless name.
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Richest in thee. Nay, Zeno!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Ye must not leave us, lords. Doge, if again 
                  We had to chuse, our choice again would fall 
                  On Foscari. Is't not so?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (apart to a Sen.)
                  Sail with the stream--- 
                  Foscari!---I'll find a time---
               
               
                  Senators.
                  Foscari! Foscari!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  One still is silent.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Now, my Father, now! 
                  For thy fame's sake.
               
               
                  Don.
                  On Foscari.
                  
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thanks! thanks! 
                  Now dare I look upon that reverend face, 
                  And grasp this hand again.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Did we not know thee!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Senators, countrymen, at your behest 
                  I wear once more the crown.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, no! no! no! 
                  Bear not again that burthen.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My Francesco, 
                  Take up thy sword again, thy knightly sword--- 
                  I am too proud of thee!---thy stainless sword! 
                  Now, good my lords, our fellow-citizens 
                  Must be made happy in this glorious tale. 
                  First to proclaim the peace; then, with meek hearts, 
                   Lowlily, with a steadfast thankfulness 
                  Pour out our homage to the Lord of Peace 
                  In his own temple. This high duty o'er, 
                  I bid ye to the palace; we must grace 
                  Our soldier with some revelry. Donato, 
                  Thou wilt be there, and Cosmo---will ye not? 
                  And our Camilla, lady of the feast, 
                  And of the heart. Come to us, dear Donato.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (apart to Don.)
                  Are all his taunts forgotten?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No! I cannot.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Think better of it, Zeno!---Follow soon, 
                  Francesco!---Zeno, is this storm the end 
                  Of our dark prophecy?
                  Exeunt Doge, Zeno & Senators.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Signor Donato, 
                  I have a feeling here of deep old love 
                  That tells me I have wronged-thee. If I have, 
                  Forgive me!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Father, canst thou turn away 
                  When Foscari speaks those words which mortal ear 
                  Ne'er heard him utter?
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  If I did mistake, 
                  'Twas in my Father's cause; 'twas such a wrong 
                  As Cosmo would have done for thee. Forgive me, 
                  For her dear sake.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  (to Don.)
                  Remember, "Shame!"
               
               
                  Don.
                   Erizzo, 
                  Think'st thou I can forget! Not even for her. 
                  Stay me not, Cosmo.
                  Exit Donato.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Go, for I can trust 
                  Thy kind heart, Father! Love, who is so strong 
                  In gentleness. Love and his bondman Time 
                  Will conquer anger. We must now submit. 
                  To-morrow---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh! what a long life of love 
                  Must I give up! To-morrow! I am here, 
                  Here in this happy Venice, which she makes 
                  The palace of her beauty, where the air 
                  Is sweetened by her breath, and her young voice 
                  Floats on the breeze like music. I am here--- 
                  Divided from her but by envious walls, 
                  Clouds that conceal my sun. Had'st thou but seen 
                  How I urged on my mettled courser's speed, 
                  My matchless Barbary horse, till his pure jet 
                  Was pounced with snowy flakes; or how I strove 
                  To graft my hot impatience on the dull 
                  And sluggish boatmen: or with what a stroke 
                  I cleft the water; or how leapt ashore---
               
               
                  Cos.
                  I can believe 't---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  That I might sooner gain 
                  By one half hour her presence! And to bear 
                   This longing till to-morrow! Thou must say 
                  All this and more, much more, of love and hope 
                  And fond impatience. Tell her---
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thou thyself
                  
                  Shalt tell her these sweet things, mixed with a world 
                  Of lovers' eloquence, of looks and sighs, 
                  And broken words. Aye, Foscari, thou thyself!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  But how? Where? When?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  To night. For one short hour 
                  Steal from the feast its hero. My good father, 
                  Who, like a bird, fore-runs the summer sun, 
                  Seeks his nest early. Thou mayst ask for me 
                  And find Camilla.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Blessings on thee, friend!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  To night!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  We have a hearer.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  He is gone.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Beware that smooth Erizzo, dearest Cosmo, 
                  Beware!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Nay, Foscari, let me caution thee 
                  Beware suspicion! Think him innocent 
                  Till thou hast proved him guilty. Blackening doubt 
                  Beseems not thy clear breast. Sweep it away.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, how I love the beautiful mistakes 
                  Of thy unbounded charity! That man--- 
                   Didst thou not see him whispering Donato? 
                  We will not think of him. Doth my Camilla 
                  Talk of me often?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh, I was sure! 
                  But it is such a joy to hear that yes! 
                  Doth she---
                  Shouts without.)
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Hark! thou art called. The citizens 
                  Demand their General. Go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I'd rather face 
                  An enemy in battle.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Thou wast wont 
                  To love the people, Foscari.
               
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I would drain 
                  The last drop in my veins for them and freedom; 
                  But these loud shouts, this popular acclaim, 
                  This withering, perishing blast of vulgar praise, 
                  Whose noisy echoes do shake off the flush 
                  Of Fame's young blossoms---Oh, I hate them all! 
                  True honour should be silent, spotless, bright, 
                  Enduring; trembling even at the breath 
                  That wooes her beauty.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Come.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               A Room in the Erizzo Palace.
               Count Erizzo entering.
               
                  Eriz.
                  Seek Signor Celso.---Baffled, spurned, contemned, 
                  Pardoned---the insolent! But he shall feel--- 
                  All lost! For old Donato, shallow fool, 
                  Hath in his anger a relenting spirit 
                  And will yield easy way at the first tear 
                  The fair Camilla sheds---the very first! 
                  She hath but to cry Father, and to hang 
                  About his neck and his light wrath will melt 
                  Like snowflakes in that rain. How the dull Senate 
                  Cowered at the haughty soldier's feet! Even I--- 
                  Thinks he I too can pardon! He shall find 
                  My hate immortal. Nothing stands between 
                  Me and the crown but Foscari. To-night--- 
                  This Celso, as I have good cause to know, 
                  Can wield a dagger well---to-night he goes 
                  To meet his lady love---to-night---alone--- 
                  I can detain young Cosmo.
                  
                  Enter Celso.
                  Celso, friend, 
                  Thou comest at a wish. Where hast thou been?
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Where I am stunned with shouts of Foscari, 
                  And dazzled with the glare of tinselled gauds 
                  Hung out to honour him. The palaces 
                  Are clothed with tissues, velvets, cloths of gold 
                  And richer tapestry. The canals all strewed 
                   With floating flowers, through which dark gondolas 
                  Dart as through some bright garden. All is lost, 
                  And I must leave dear Venice. Count, farewell!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Why must thou go?
               
               
                  Cel.
                  Ask my hard creditors.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Celso, I have a thousand ducats here 
                  For him that rids me of a clinging plague.
               
               
                  Cel.
                  A thousand ducats!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Hast thou still thy dagger? 
                  In, and I'll tell thee more. This very night!
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF ACT THE SECOND.
               
            
         
         
            ACT III.
            
               SCENE I.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               Donato, Camilla and Laura.
               
                  Laura.
                  Camilla, why so drooping?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  This hath been 
                  A long and weary day; there is a heat, 
                  A gloom, a heavy closeness. See, this rose 
                  Is withering too, that was so fresh and fair--- 
                  The white musk-rose---that which he used to love.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  It was no day for Venice. 'Twould have been 
                  A calm sweet stillness in our country home, 
                  Bowered amid green leaves and growing flowers, 
                  With fragrant airs about us, and soft light, 
                  And rustling birds.
               
               
                  Don.
                  The sky portends a storm. 
                  To bed, Camilla!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Father! dearest father, 
                  Have I displeased thee?
               
               
                  Don.
                  No! To bed! To bed! 
                  Laura, good night.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He used to call me child, 
                  His dearest child; and when I grasped his hand 
                  Would hold me from him with a long fond gaze,
                  
                  And stroke my hair and kiss my brow, and bid 
                  Heaven bless his sweet Camilla! And to night 
                  Nought but to bed! to bed!
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Believe it, Cousin, 
                   A thing of accident.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And Cosmo comes not; 
                  He sends not to me---he that never broke 
                  His plighted word before! And Laura! Laura! 
                  Foscari is in Venice, is returned 
                  Triumphant, and he comes not, sends not, Laura! 
                  And when I ask of him my father frowns 
                  Sternly on his poor child.
                  Re-enter Donato.
               
               
                  Don.
                  My pretty-one, 
                  I could not go to rest, till I had said 
                  Heaven bless thee!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  My dear father!
               
               
                  Don.
                  What is this? 
                  A tear?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Oh! gratitude and love and joy 
                  Are in that tear, dear father!---and one doubt--- 
                  One fear---
               
               
                  Don.
                  Sweetest, good night!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Foscari, father?
               
               
                  Don.
                  To bed my own Camilla!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Not a word.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Something works in him deeply.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet how kind, 
                  How exquisitely fond! Cosmo must know, 
                  And, Laura, Cosmo never flies from thee, 
                   And thou may'st ask---
               
               
                  Laura.
                  I will, I will, sweet Coz! 
                  Look, dearest, at the glancing gondolas
                  
                  Shooting along, each with its little light, 
                  Like stars upon the water. Whither go they?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  To the proud Ducal Palace, where they hold 
                  High feasting in his honour. There the dance, 
                  And the quaint masque, and music's softer strains 
                  Minister to his praises.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  And the ear 
                  That would drink in so eagerly that sweet praise, 
                  The heart that would leap up at every sound 
                  Rejoicing, the glad eyes---Would thou wert there!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Ah! would I were, since Foscari is there; 
                  That is enough for me! Where'er he is, 
                  In tent or battle-field---Hark! what is that? 
                  That music? Oh 'tis he! 'tis Foscari! 
                  Dost thou not know the strain, the wandering strain, 
                  Trembling and floating like a spirit's song, 
                  With many a---Hark again!---'Tis he! 'tis he! 
                  That air belongs to him even as a name 
                  It thrills my very heart. Am I not pale?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  No; the bright blood floats trembling in thy cheek, 
                  Most like that wandering music.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  There is pain 
                   In this excess of joy.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  He comes.
                  Enter Foscari.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Camilla! 
                  Sweetest Camilla!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Thou art come at last 
                  Francesco!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  My Camilla---Come at last! 
                  Why this is chiding! Can'st thou chide, Camilla?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Aye, or she were no woman.
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Lady Laura! 
                  Forgive me that I saw you not. Camilla, 
                  Chide on---nay thou art smiling---Come begin! 
                  I'd rather hear thy chidings than the praise 
                  Of all the world beside. Let me but hear 
                  Thy voice, whate'er thou speakest.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Dear Francesco, 
                  Thou hast been long away.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Oh very long!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And where?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Away from thee. That is enough; 
                  Where thou art not I keep no count of place 
                  Nor time, nor speech, nor act.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet tell me where.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Where I have dreamt of courts and camps and fields 
                  Of glorious battle. A long weary dream 
                   To him, who loves to bask him in thy smiles, 
                  And live upon thy words.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yet hast thou lost 
                  Ten weary hours to-day.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Why this, indeed, 
                  Is chiding, my Camilla. I have been 
                  At the Palace, at the Senate hall, at Church, 
                  Have undergone a grand procession, love, 
                  And a long dreary feast.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  And is that all?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  And is not that enough? Would'st thou crowd in 
                  More tediousness? Oh thou unmerciful!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  But why not first---sure he is thinner, Laura, 
                  Thinner and paler?
               
               
                  Laura.
                  Nay, he is the same.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Why not first come to me?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Perhaps I love 
                  
                  To visit my heart's treasure by that light 
                  When misers seek their buried hoards; to steal 
                  Upon the loved one, like a mermaid's song, 
                  Unseen and floating between sea and sky; 
                  To creep upon her in love's loveliest hour, 
                  Not in her daylight beauty with the glare 
                  Of the bright sun around her, but thus pure 
                  And white and delicate, under the cool moon 
                   Or lamp of alabaster. Thus I love 
                  To think of thee, Camilla; thus with flowers 
                  About thee and fresh air, and such a light, 
                  And such a stillness; thus I dream of thee, 
                  Sleeping or waking.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Dost thou dream of me?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Do I! without that lovely mockery, 
                  That sweet unreal joy, how could I live 
                  When we are parted? Do I dream of thee! 
                  Dearest, what ails thee? Thou art not to night 
                  As thou art wont, thine eyes avoid my gaze, 
                  Thy white hand trembles and turns cold in mine. 
                  What ails thee, dearest? Hast thou heard---What fear 
                  Disturbs thee thus, Camilla?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  I will tell thee. 
                  Cosmo is absent; my dear father grieved; 
                  There is high feasting in thy princely home 
                  And I not there; and thou not here till now, 
                  At midnight, when my father sleeps, and Cosmo 
                  Is still away. Are ye all friends? Say Foscari 
                  The very truth.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Well! Thou shalt hear the truth. 
                  Cheer thee! 'Tis nought to weep for. At the Senate 
                  There were to-day some hasty words.---Erizzo, 
                  Thy subtle kinsman, he was most to blame--- 
                   I was too hot, too rash; but I implored 
                  
                  Donato's pardon, and am half forgiven; 
                  Though yielding to the crafty Count, he shunned 
                  To sup with us to-night.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Ah! I had feared---
               
               
                  Fos.
                  There is no cause for fear. This sudden storm 
                  Is but a July shower that sweeps away 
                  The o'erblown roses. Cosmo is our friend, 
                  Our truest warmest friend; and well thou know'st 
                  Thy father's kindly heart; he loves thee so; 
                  Aye, and he loves me too; and he shall love me 
                  Better than ever.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  He shall love! Lord Foscari 
                  Thou'rt a true soldier. Wilt thou conquer love?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Surely.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  And how?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  By love, and gratitude, 
                  And deep respect, and true observance, Laura. 
                  Shake not thy head, Camilla. He shall love me. 
                  What is he not thy father! Smile on me. 
                  Think'st thou that if I feared to lose thee I 
                  Should be thus tranquil?
                  Exit Laura.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  No. But at my heart 
                  There is a heavy sense of coming pain, 
                  A deep and sad foreboding.
               
               
                  Fos.
                   Thou hast been 
                  Vexed to-day, sweetest, and thy weary thoughts 
                  Tinge the bright future with the gloomy past.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Well, be it so. And yet I would to heaven 
                  That this one night were over!---Where is Laura?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  She glided off, with a kind parting smile, 
                  And a quick sparkle in her eye, that said 
                  Ye will not miss me!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Aye, her merry glance;
                  
                  But we do miss her. 'Twas a saucy thought, 
                  My pretty gentle Laura!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  She is grown.
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Yes, tall and beautiful and rarely good. 
                  Oh 'tis the kindest heart! We think she'll make--- 
                  What is that noise?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Nothing. A distant door. 
                  What startles thee, Camilla?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  My own heart. 
                  Hark how it beats, painfully, fearfully! 
                  Hush! hush! Again that noise!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  'Tis thunder, love, 
                  And that hath stirred thy spirits. Cheer thee, dearest; 
                  A soldier's wife should be as brave as steel. 
                  What did'st thou say of Laura?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  She will make 
                   A sweet wife for our Cosmo.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  And doth he 
                  Love the young beauty?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He hath scarce forgot 
                  To treat her as a child, the dearest child, 
                  The loveliest and the gentlest,---but a child. 
                  Francesco, thou must praise her---Ha! again! 
                  That is no thunder-clap. My father's door!--- 
                  Oh go! go! go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  My dear Camilla, no! 
                  Thou can'st not fear me, I will be as calm, 
                  As humble---
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Go! go! go! I die with fear;--- 
                  He is so rash, so sudden;---He will kill thee!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Here! Under his own roof! In thy dear sight! 
                  Thy own dear father!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  He will part us, Foscari! 
                  Go!
                  
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Well, I go. But my Camilla---
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Go!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Dearest, farewell!
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Not that way!---That! there! there! 
                  Leap from the window in the corridor, 
                  From the low balcony!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Farewell!
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Cam.
                   I'm glad 
                  That he is gone. Fear hath so mastered me 
                  I stumble on the level floor. Thank heaven 
                  They are both safe, my dearest Foscari, 
                  My dearest father! There's no danger now; 
                  And yet the night grows wilder. What a flash! 
                  And I have sent him forth into the storm, 
                  I, that so love him! I have sent him forth 
                  Into this awful storm! Protect him, Heaven! 
                  I thought I heard the window---Can those steps 
                  Be his?
               
               
                  Don.
                  (without)
                  Help! help! base traitor! Foscari! 
                  Murder!
                  Enter Laura.
               
               
                  Laura.
                  What's that?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  Undo the door---I cannot--- 
                  Undo the door! My father!
                  Exeunt.

                  (behind the scenes)
                  Who hath done 
                  This horrible deed?
               
               
                  Cam.
                  (behind the scenes)
                  My father! muder! murder!
               
               
            
            
               SCENE II.
               An illuminated Hall in the Ducal Palace.
               Doge, Count Zeno, Ladies and Gentlemen.
               
                  Doge.
                  Now for some stirring air to wake the spirits 
                  Of mirth and motion. Sweet ones, to the dance! 
                  Where is this Foscari? Gentles, in my youth 
                  He had been held a recreant that forsook 
                  The revel, and the light of ladies' eyes, 
                  And play of twinkling feet. Degenerate boy!
               
               
                  Gent.
                  Degenerate days! Ah! we could tell such tales 
                  Of the deep merriment, the gorgeous banquet, 
                  The high festivity of our old time! 
                  Thou may'st smile, Zeno, but his Highness knows 
                  Bright mirth is on the wane. Our puny sons 
                  Shew but faint flashes of their father's fire.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Believe him not, fair maids! 'Tis but the vaunt 
                  Of vaunting age. Believe him not. Why, Moro, 
                  Thy father in those mirthful days hath said 
                  The same to thee, and his to him; yet still 
                  'Tis merry Venice. Forty years to come 
                  We, too, may boast us of our jovial prime, 
                  Nor yet the world grow sadder. Fear it not. 
                  His Highness will not join thee, Signor Moro; 
                  He is too youthful-hearted.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  What a bribe 
                  Is that to aid thy cause! But Moro's right; 
                  We were fine gallants. Niece, I prythee see 
                   That all are welcomed. Where's thy sister Melfi?
               
               
                  2nd Gent.
                  Not yet returned from Rome.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I would have had 
                  
                  All the fair stars of Venice here to night 
                  Shining in one bright galaxy.
               
               
                  Gent.
                  We miss 
                  Signor Donato's daughter.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Aye, indeed, 
                  My pretty sweet Camilla!---Fair Olivia, 
                  Let Trevisano lead thee to the dance. 
                  Were I one ten years younger, trust me, Sir, 
                  I'd not resign this hand. Now a light measure. 
                  A Dance.
                  Is't not a peerless nymph? The youngest Grace 
                  Leading her linked sisters through the maze 
                  Of blossom'd myrtles upon Ida's side, 
                  Is not so light of foot. Rest thee, dear maid. 
                  What is that? Thunder?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Yes; a fearful storm. 
                  It rages awfully. Hark! there again!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Well; we must keep such coil of merriment 
                  As shall outroar the rattling storm. 
                  Enter Foscari.
                  Ah, truant! 
                  How wilt thou make thy peace?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  I read no war 
                  In these fair looks.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                   Peace is more perilous.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Aye, truly, Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Whither hast thou been? 
                  Watching her lattice but to catch a glimpse 
                  Of the swift slender shadow that glides past 
                  So gracefully, clouding the soft dim light?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Pooh! Pooh!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  And with a true devotion bent 
                  Uncovered at her shrine? Why thou art wet!
                  
                  This is some new device of gallantry, 
                  Some trick of Milan courtship.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Tush, man, tush! 
                  Ho! a brisk measure! Drown with merry notes 
                  Count Zeno's merry riddles! Wilt thou dance 
                  With me, dear lady? Do not say me No!
               
               
                  Lady.
                  Oh, no!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Why that should mean Oh yes!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Good niece, 
                  Will not the Lady Claudia join the dance? 
                  Seek her. I'm young and light enough to night 
                  To mingle there myself. What ails the music? 
                  Quicker! Why break they off? Dear Zeno ask.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Murdered! Impossible! I only left--- 
                  I am myself---It cannot be. Play on! 
                  On with the dance!
               
               
                  Gent.
                   Here is a man hath seen him, 
                  One who still shakes with fear.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Bring him to me! 
                  Where is he? Where?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Zeno, what is this tale?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  A tale of horror!
                  Enter Erizzo.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Justice, Doge of Venice! 
                  A Senator lies reeking in his blood, 
                  Murdered in his own palace. Justice, Doge!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  What Senator?
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Canst thou ask that? Donato.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Donato murdered! the beloved Donato! 
                  The second name of Venice! Mine old friend! 
                  Lords, to the council. This is not a tale 
                  For woman's gentleness. Good night to all. 
                  Exeunt Ladies, and some Gentlemen.
                  
                  Would he had ta'en my hand!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  He is not dead--- 
                  It must be false, it shall be!
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  What dost thou 
                  Doubt of Donato's death? Thou?
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Hearken, Doge! 
                  His voice hath mockery in it, sharp and loud 
                  As the clear ring of metals: he speaks not 
                  As we, who heard the tale, in broken words 
                  And breathless; his teeth chatter not; his lips 
                   Are firm; there is no trembling in his limbs, 
                  No glare in his keen eyes. None but a fiend, 
                  Fresh from the reek of murder, could so master 
                  The human sympathy, the fellowship 
                  Of Nature and of kind.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Yet wherefore---
                  Enter Cosmo.

                  Beloved friend!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Off! Off! I come for justice, 
                  For equal justice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou shalt have it.

                  Doge.
                  Was he not my friend? 
                  Am I not thine?
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Aye---so the murderer said!--- 
                  Friend! the word chokes me.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Grief hath turned his brain.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou shalt have justice.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  'Tis no midnight thief, 
                  No hired assassin, no poor petty villain;--- 
                  This is a fall, as of the morning star, 
                  
                  A death such as the first great slayer saw 
                  When Abel lay at his feet,---but I'll have justice! 
                  There be hearts here will crack, old valiant hearts 
                   When they shall hear this tale,---but I'll have justice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Go some one call the guard. 
                  Exit Erizzo.

                  Fos.
                  Thou! 
                  Come forth into the light! Off with those plumes! 
                  Look at me! Is this Cosmo? Hath some fiend 
                  Put on that shape? Speak to me!
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Murderer!
               
               
                  Fos.
                  To-day he called me brother!---Deal with me 
                  Even as ye will.
               
               
                  Eriz.
                  Look to him, soldiers, well, 
                  That he escape not.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Sir, the Foscari 
                  Know not what that word means. I wait your pleasure.
               
               
                  Cos.
                  Doge! Doth he hear me? Once I could have wept 
                  For such a grief, for him; now I am steeled 
                  By merciless misery, made pitiless 
                   By one that hath no pity. Look! he stands 
                  With such a calm of virtue on his brow, 
                  As if he would outface the all-seeing God 
                  With that proud seeming. Foscari, the dead 
                  Shall cry aloud in heaven, and I on earth, 
                  Till vengeance overtake thee. Doge of Venice, 
                  I call on thee for justice on thy son.
               
               
                  Fos.
                  Father!---Oh, start not!---I am innocent. 
                  Hear that, and breathe again. Sir, I commit 
                  My life, my honour, the unsullied name 
                  
                  Of my great ancestors, of him the greatest 
                  My living father---even his name I trust 
                  To my just cause, and the just laws of Venice. 
                  I am your prisoner.
                  Exeunt Foscari, guarded, Erizzo and
								Cosmo.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Doge!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Those lights! Those lights! 
                  They pierce my eye-balls, dart into my brain! 
                  If there be any pity left i' the world 
                  Make me a darkness and a silence, Zeno, 
                  That I may pray.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Lead to his chamber, Sirs.
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF ACT THE THIRD.
               
            
         
         
            ACT IV.
            
               SCENE I.
               A Hall of Justice.
               Cosmo, Erizzo, Senators, and Officers.
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Is all prepared for trial?
               
               
                  Officer.
                  All. The Doge 
                  Approaches.
               
               
                  Senator.
                  Will the Doge preside?
               
               
                  2nd Senator.
                  He comes. 
                  How different from his step of yesterday! 
                  How hurried, yet how slow!
                  Enter Doge and Count Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Let me assist 
                  Your Highness.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  His robes encumber him; 
                  Support them.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Why will you torment me, Sir, 
                  With this officious care? These flowers are naught. 
                  Go bring me pungent herbs, hyssop and rue 
                  And rosemary; odours that keep in sense--- 
                  I have forgot my handkerchief.
                  
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Take this.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I am an old man newly stung with grief--- 
                  Thou hast forgiven me, Zeno? Are ye ready? 
                  Where is the accuser?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  May it please your Highness 
                  Call forth the prisoner.
                  Enter Foscari, guarded.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh not thou good Doge; 
                   Spare those white hairs!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Dare not to pity me! 
                  Sir, those white hairs are lichens on a rock. 
                  I tell ye, Sirs, since yesternight my blood 
                  Is dried up in my veins, my heart is turned 
                  To stone; but I am Doge of Venice still 
                  And know my office. Fear me not, Francesco! 
                  Francesco Foscari---Sir, is he there? 
                  My eyes are old and dim.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I am here Father! 
                  Doge! I am here.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Francesco Foscari 
                  Thou art arraigned for the foul midnight murder 
                  Of the senator Donato. Art thou innocent? 
                  Or guilty?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Canst thou ask? The fresh-born babe 
                  That knows not yet the guiltiness of thought, 
                  Is not from such crime whiter.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Gracious heaven 
                  I thank thee! Now the weight is off my soul. 
                  I sinned in my black fear. Where's the accuser? 
                  Let him stand forth. Cosmo---Signor Donato, 
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Look with how calm and proud a mien 
                  
                  The murderer stands, whilst the poor son conceals 
                   His face against the wall.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Speak, pr'y thee, speak.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Alas! alas! I cannot. We were friends 
                  Even from earliest childhood. I loved him--- 
                  Oh how I loved him! Aye and he loved me, 
                  With a protecting love, the firmest love; 
                  For stronger, bolder, hardier, he to me 
                  Was as an elder brother. And his home 
                  Was mine, and mine was his---Oh he has sate 
                  A hundred times on that dear father's knee, 
                  His little head nestling against that breast, 
                  Where now---Oh Foscari, hadst thou slain me 
                  My last word had been pardon! But my father, 
                  And with a stedfast and unaltering cheek 
                  To listen---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Cosmo! I am innocent. 
                  Yet, Heaven knows, I grieve---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla's father--- 
                  Poor, poor Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  (aside)
                  Ah thou hast it now! 
                  'Tis a fair woman's soft and liquid name 
                  That stings thy soul! Good, good.---Ho! Officer! 
                  Apart to an Officer, giving him a paper.
                  Deliver that and bring the witness hither, 
                  Look thou take no excuse.
                  Exit Officer.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Signor Donato, 
                   I pray you check these pardonable tears. 
                  Were this a place for passion, what's thy grief 
                  Measured with mine? The death of all thy name 
                  To this suspense, this agony, this shame, 
                  That eats away the soul? What is thy grief--- 
                  Master thyself, I say. Francesco Foscari 
                  
                  Stands there to answer to thy charge of murder. 
                  Produce thy proofs.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Bring in the corse. My Lord 
                  And ye, the equal judges, spare the son 
                  This miserable duty. I can tell, 
                  For I by chance was there, this tale of blood 
                  And mystery. The late unhappy feud 
                  Is known to all. Returning from St. Mark's 
                  With my young kinsman in his Gondola--- 
                  For I had missed of mine---we landed close 
                  To the Donato Palace, as the bell 
                  Was tolling midnight. 'Twas an awful storm; 
                  But by the flashing lightning we saw one 
                  Leap from the balcony---a Cavalier 
                  Splendid in dress and air. The lightning glared 
                  Full on his face and habit, unconcealed 
                  By hat or cloak, and instantly we knew 
                  Francesco Foscari.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Art sure of that?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   Oh sure! Too sure!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  He passed so close Count Zeno, 
                  That my cloak brushed his vest; but sprang aside, 
                  As he had met an adder, and leaped down 
                  Into a waiting Gondola. I called, 
                  But Foscari answered not; and Cosmo spake, 
                  Betwixt a sigh and smile, of fair Camilla, 
                  Of their long loves, and of the morning's ire, 
                  And how he hoped this dark and sudden cloud 
                  Would speedily pass away. Even as he spake, 
                  Whilst loitering on the steps, we heard a shriek 
                  Within the house, so piercing, so prolonged, 
                  So born of bitter anguish---to this hour 
                  That shriek is ringing in mine ears! And when, 
                  
                  With trembling hearts and failing limbs, we scaled 
                  The stairs, we saw Donato bathed in blood, 
                  And poor Camilla lying on his breast, 
                  Her arms strained round his neck, as if she tried 
                  To keep in his dear life. 
                  The corse brought in.
                  The bloody witness 
                  Of this foul deed is here.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Poor good old man! 
                  This is a grievous sight.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh! Would to Heaven 
                  That I so lay, and so---I pray thee, on. 
                   Where are thy proofs?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  They shall come soon enough. 
                  Donato, rouse thee! Look upon those wounds! 
                  Think on the honoured dead!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I dare not think, 
                  For thought is frenzy. Lords! The Count Erizzo 
                  Hath told ye how we found the corse. This sword, 
                  The well-known sword of Foscari, was plunged 
                  Deep in his gory breast; beside him lay 
                  This hat and cloak, the splendid soldier's garb 
                  Of Foscari; no man had approached the house 
                  Save only Foscari; and his last word, 
                  Mingled with cries of murder and of help, 
                  Was "Foscari." Is that sword thine? Disown it, 
                  And, against oath and proof and circumstance. 
                  Thy word---thy naked word---Disown that sword, 
                  And give me back the blessed faith that trusts 
                  In man my fellow! Look upon it well.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  'Tis mine.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  He's guilty. 'Twas the last faint hope 
                  On this side Heaven.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Cosmo! It is not his--- 
                  He knows not what he says---Give me the sword.
                  
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  'Tis mine; that which lay sheathed in victory 
                  Before ye yesterday; that which I bore 
                   Triumphing through the battle. What a blaze 
                  Streamed from the sparkling steel---how bright, how pure, 
                  How glorious, how like the light of Fame--- 
                  A wild and dazzling fire! Both, both are quenched. 
                  The sword is mine; but of this foulest deed 
                  I am as ignorant as the senseless blade.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Who heard Donato call on Foscari?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Doge, thou hast asked for proofs, for witnesses; 
                  I have one here. Officer, hast thou brought 
                  The lady?
               
               
                  Officer.
                  She attends.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Go lead her in.
                  Exit Officer.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What lady? Sure thou canst not mean---
                  Enter Officer leading Camilla.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She walks as in a heavy dream; her senses 
                  Are stupified by sorrow. Count Erizzo, 
                  Why dids't thou send for her? Why bring her here? 
                  Had we not breaking hearts enow before 
                  Without poor, poor Camilla?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She alone 
                  Heard his last dying words. Lady Camilla!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She neither sees nor hears; she is herself 
                  A moving corse.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Camilla! Speak to her.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister! Heaven shield her senses! She is deaf 
                   Even to my voice. Dear sister!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Lead her towards 
                  The body. So! she sees it.
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Father! Father! 
                  Have I found thee dear father? Let me sit 
                  Here at thy feet, and lean my aching head 
                  Against thy knee---Oh how it throbs!---and bury 
                  My face within thy cloak. What ails me, Father, 
                  That my heart flutters so? Feel here---He's cold! 
                  He's dead! He's dead!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Who art thou? 
                  Where am I? Wherefore have ye dragged me forth 
                  Into the glare of day---Oh cruel! cruel!--- 
                  Amongst strange men? Where am I? Foscari! Now 
                  I have a comforter. Have they not told thee 
                  That I am fatherless? Dost weep for me? 
                  For me?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Leave him; he is a murderer. 
                  Thy father's murderer!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Who dared say that? 
                  Francesco, speak to me!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Pollute her not! 
                  Touch not her garments! Fly his very sight--- 
                  He slew thy Father.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   Ha! Again! Again! 
                  Cosmo, this man is false. Is he not Cosmo? 
                  Is he not all one falsehood? Answer me. 
                  I will kneel to thee, Cosmo, for a word, 
                  A sign. Press but my hand. He lets it fall!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister---I cannot tell her.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Thou thyself 
                  Art witness to his crime.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  I never knew 
                  Aught of him but his virtues.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Noble lady, 
                  Thou art before the assembled power of Venice, 
                  
                  Before thy father's corse, before high Heaven--- 
                  Answer me truly, lady---Didst thou hear 
                  Thy murdered father call on Foscari?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Ah!---He is innocent.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Didst thou not hear 
                  Foscari's name mixed with his dying shriek?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He's innocent! Oh I would stake my life 
                  On Foscari's innocence.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Beloved child:
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Ah! Art thou there? Release him; Set him free! 
                  Thou art the Doge, the mighty Doge of Venice, 
                  Thou hast the power to free him.---Save him now 
                  From my hard kinsman! Save him! I remember, 
                   When I was but a little child, I craved 
                  The grace of a poor galley slave, and thou 
                  Didst pardon him and set him free as air;--- 
                  Wilt thou not save thy son, and such a son, 
                  Who is as clear of this foul sin as thou? 
                  Cosmo, kneel with me!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I have knelt for justice; 
                  And now again---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  For mercy! mercy!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Answer! 
                  Demand her answer, Doge. She is a witness, 
                  Command her by thy power; thou art the Judge.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I am, I am. Ye should have Dukes of stone, 
                  But this is flesh. Camilla, I am not 
                  A King, who wears fair mercy on the cross 
                  Of his bright diadem; I have no power 
                  Save as the whetted axe to strike and slay, 
                  A will-less instrument of the iron law 
                  Of Venice. Daughter---Thou that should'st have been 
                  My daughter, we are martyrs at the stake, 
                  
                  And must endure. Shall we not copy him, 
                  Who stands there, with so brave a constancy, 
                  Patient, unfaltering? Let us chuse the right, 
                  And leave the event to Heaven. Speak, my dear child.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Heaven guide me then! Lords, I am here an orphan, 
                   The orphan of one day.---But yesternight--- 
                  Oh! did ye ever see a father die?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Calm thee my sister.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And ye drag me hither--- 
                  Ye call me to bear witness---me, a woman; 
                  A wretched helpless woman!---Against him, 
                  Whom---ye are merciless---ye have no touch 
                  Of pity or of manhood! Do your worst; 
                  I will not answer ye.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh woman's love, 
                  Pure nurse of kind and charitable thoughts, 
                  Wiser than wisdom, instinct of the soul, 
                  How do I bless thee holiest love! Camilla, 
                  My brave and true Camilla, thou hast dropt 
                  Balm in the festering wound. Yet answer them. 
                  I cannot fear the truth. Ask her once more.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Were not the last words that Donato spake 
                  Foscari and murder?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Take her away; 
                  She hath confessed enough.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh no! no! no! 
                  Foscari is guiltless! Hear me!---He is guiltless!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Canst thou prove that? Thy sweet face always brought 
                  A comfort. Prove but that.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  (Aside.)
                   All curses on 
                  The coward Celso! He'll escape me yet. 
                  
                  Aloud.)
                  The facts? The proofs? The witnesses?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  His life; 
                  My heart, my bursting heart. If I had seen 
                  With these poor eyes that horror---had seen him 
                  Stabbing---Oh, thoughts like these may make me mad, 
                  But all the powers of earth and hell can never 
                  Shake my true faith! Foscari! I will share 
                  Thy fate, will die with thee, will be thy bride 
                  Even in that fatal hour, and pass away 
                  With thee to Heaven---So! so!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  She sinks; she sinks; 
                  Her strength is over-wrought. Oh die not yet 
                  Till I may die with thee! Awake, revive, 
                  My plighted love! The bridal hour will soon 
                  Unite us my Camilla. Help! she faints.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Fold her not thus within thy arms! Resign her!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To thee! While still this arm hath marrow in it! 
                  To thee! Cosmo---thou---thou---Be tender of her, 
                  Be very tender---'tis a broken flower--- 
                  And pardon her her love. Take her. The pain 
                  Of death is over now. Proceed, my lords.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Let me support her, Cosmo. Thou dost stagger 
                  Under her slender form.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   He spake to me, 
                  He gazed on me---I felt the long sad look 
                  Dwell on my face---he, at whose crime my soul 
                  Shudders, he spake---and I---men would have thought 
                  I was the guilty one! He bade me love 
                  This dearest, wretchedest. Tell him---No! no! 
                  Not even a last word.
               
               Exeunt Cosmo and Zeno, with Camilla.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  This hapless maid 
                  Hath owned enough. Foscari, wilt thou confess 
                  The murder?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I am innocent.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Confess; 
                  Or we must force confession. To the rack!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Never whilst I have life! Am I not still 
                  The Doge of Venice? Rather stretch these stiff 
                  And withered limbs upon thy engines, Count! 
                  Rather crack these old joints! I thought that I 
                  Was steeled against all strokes---but this---
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The rack!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Bethink thee of the Roman fathers, Doge, 
                  Of Brutus and of Manlius; thy son 
                  Will not disgrace thee. Come, the rack, the rack! 
                  I will front pain as a brave enemy, 
                  And rush to the encounter. What is the sense 
                  Of bodily agony to that which I 
                   Endure even now? Disgrace, suspicion, scorn, 
                  Hatred and haughty pity, and that last 
                  Worst pang---her love, her misery. These are tortures! 
                  Let me have something that a warrior's soul 
                  May strive against and conquer. Come, the rack!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Never.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  I must not hear thee, Doge. The question!
                  Re-enter Cosmo and Zeno.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Stop, on your lives! Forbear this cruelty, 
                  This cowardly cruelty! He will endure--- 
                  He will call up the courage of the field 
                  And die before he groans. His eye surveys 
                  That engine steadily, whose very sight 
                  Makes my flesh creep. Remove it. Oh to see 
                  
                  That butchery---and the old man---the poor old man! 
                  Remove it.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Well. Proceed we then to sentence.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  First listen to the prisoner. Foscari! speak.
               
               
                  Senator.
                  Yes; let us hear his tale. Defend thyself.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To ye who doubt! To ye who disbelieve! 
                  Sir, there are spirits that can never stoop 
                  To falsehood; not for wealth, or power, or fame, 
                  Or life, or dearer love. Oh, were ye cast 
                  In the old chivalrous mould, pure diamond souls 
                  On which the dim polluting touch of doubt 
                  Rests not a breathing time! Were ye built up 
                   Of honour---But to ye---Why should I speak 
                  When I have nothing but my knightly word 
                  To prove me innocent?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  You are well paid 
                  By this contempt, Count Zeno. Now to judgment.
                  The Doge, Zeno, Erizzo, and the Senators retire
								to the back of the stage, leaving Cosmo and Foscari in the
								front.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Father! He passes on and doth not speak; 
                  He cannot; he has no words,---nothing but tears. 
                  Oh, what must the grief be that forces tears 
                  From his proud heart---his proud and bursting heart! 
                  The flame of youth burnt in him yesterday 
                  At fourscore years; to-day hath made him old. 
                  What groan was that? What other wretch? Donato! 
                  Cosmo! Wilt thou not answer?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh that voice 
                  Which was such perfect music,---which seemed made 
                  For truth and thought, fit organ, how it jars 
                  My very soul! What would'st thou?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I would thank thee 
                  
                  That thou hast spared one pang to a brave heart. 
                  That rack---To have seen me stretched there, to direct 
                  Each fresh progressive torture.---He had died 
                  Before our eyes! I thank thee, sir. No more. 
                  Unless a dying man, for I am sentenced--- 
                  Look how he sinks his head upon his clenched 
                  And withered hands! I am condemned, and we 
                   Shall meet no more. Thou wilt not join the headsman 
                  To see the axe fall on my neck, nor follow 
                  The shouting multitude who, yesterday, 
                  Hail'd me a god, and, with like shouts, to-morrow 
                  Will drag me to the block. We meet no more; 
                  And as a dying man I fain would part 
                  In charity. We were friends, Cosmo.---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Friends! 
                  I sinned in listening; but whilst he spake 
                  A world of kindly thoughts, a gush of the deep 
                  Old passionate love came o'er my heart---Forgive me 
                  Oh blessed shade! Friends! Why thy crime were common 
                  Wanting that damning dye---a simple murder! 
                  What though of one kind, noble, generous, 
                  Whose princely spirit scattered happiness 
                  As the sun light---a single sin! But 'twas 
                  My father, mine---avenging angel hear!--- 
                  Mine, that so loved thee.---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  That, at the first glance 
                  Of wild suspicion, the first crafty word 
                  Of treacherous hate, doubted, accused, condemned--- 
                  Chasing through shameful trial to shameful death--- 
                  Yet daring to call down the wrath of God 
                  On a false friend! Oh cunning self-deceit! 
                  Oh wondrous cheat of blind mortality! 
                  
                   Thus doth the Evil Spirit cast about 
                  To win a soul from heaven. They come. They come. 
                  Now gentle death. 
                  The Doge, Erizzo, Zeno, and Senators
								advance.
                  Speak! I can better bear 
                  Thy words than that long gaze of agony. 
                  I am prepared.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Oh why did I resume 
                  This bonnet, which thy filial hand had plucked 
                  From my old brow, this fatal coronet, 
                  Predoomed to fall, that scorches me like fire--- 
                  Stings me like twisted serpents! Would I were 
                  A naked slave, chained to his weary oar, 
                  A worm that hath no sense but sufferance, 
                  Any thing vilest and most miserable, 
                  Rather than Doge of Venice! I must plunge 
                  A dagger in thy breast. Francesco Foscari, 
                  The council doth pronounce thee guilty.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  It works. It works.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thou said'st thou wast prepared.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Aye---but the word! 
                  The first sound of the word!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  The council doth condemn---
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  All, father? All?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  No; there were two---Count Zeno could not join 
                   Guilty and Foscari; and I---my son, 
                  Thou couldst not do this deed!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Thank heaven! Thank heaven!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The sentence, Doge!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Yes, father. The one pang, 
                  The worse than death,---the infamy is past. 
                  
                  The dagger's in my breast; now drive it home, 
                  And with a merciful speed.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Sir, thou will find 
                  Justice hath bowed to mercy.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Doge, the sentence!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  The penalty is death. But for thy rank, 
                  Thy services and mine, it is exchanged 
                  For banishment to Candia. Thou must live 
                  In Canea, an exile, till thy days 
                  Be ended, my dear son.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Live! Give me death! 
                  Ye that give infamy, and dare to talk 
                  Of mercy, give me death, painfullest death, 
                  And I will thank ye---bless ye! Give me death! 
                  Ye cannot give me life. Sooner the bay, 
                  That wreathes the warrior's brows, shall spread and flourish 
                  In a dark mine, shut up from sun and air, 
                  Than I can live without a proud respect 
                  A white unblemish'd name, the light and breath 
                   Of honour. Death I say!---a murderer's death! 
                  Ye dare not change the laws.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Live, and repent.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Cosmo, if e'er you loved me, call on them 
                  For justice---bloody justice! Doge of Venice, 
                  Maintain the insulted laws! Send me to death,--- 
                  To instant death! Oh father, free thy son 
                  From this dread load of misery! Would'st thou see 
                  Thy only child shunned as a leper, father? 
                  Sent out into the world a second Cain? 
                  Oh give me death! death! death!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I knew that life 
                  Would be a lingering agony; and yet 
                  To kill thee---my dear son! Oh prophecy 
                  Accurst, I feel thee now!
                  
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Remove the prisoner. 
                  What! doth he struggle?
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Touch him not, vile slaves!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  A moment pause, and ye may lead me hence 
                  Tame as a fondled kid. Ye Senators, 
                  Ye kings of Venice, I appeal from you 
                  To the Supreme Tribunal.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  To thy father?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  To Him that is in heaven. Ye are men, 
                  Frail, erring, ignorant men, guided or driven 
                   By every warring passion: some by love 
                  Of the beloved Donati; some by hate 
                  Of the high Foscari; by envy some; 
                  Many by fear; and one by low ambition. 
                  This ye call justice, lords! But I appeal 
                  To the All-righteous Judge of earth and heaven, 
                  Before whose throne condemners and condemned 
                  All shall stand equal, at whose feet I swear, 
                  By what my soul holds sacred---by the spurs 
                  Of knighthood---by the Christian's holier Cross, 
                  And by that old man's white and reverend locks, 
                  That I am innocent. Ye, who disbelieve, 
                  And ye who doubt, and ye, the grovelling few, 
                  Believing who condemn, I shower on all 
                  Contempt and pardon. Now, guards, to the prison.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Look to the Doge.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Zeno, when I am gone 
                  Thou wilt be kind to him?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Even as a son! 
                  Even as thyself.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Thou truest friend, farewell!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Look to the Doge 
               
               END OF THE FOURTH ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE I.
               An Apartment in the Donato Palace.
               Cosmo and Erizzo.
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Gone to the prison! No! my lord Erizzo. 
                  I know Camilla.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Well---I might mistake.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Straight from her father's bier, where all night long 
                  She watch'd and wept, to seek---Go to, thou'rt wrong! 
                  Thou'rt wrong.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Think no more of it. Doth the Senate 
                  Meet to-day?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Was she veil'd?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Who?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Whom thou saw'st. 
                  She---not my sister!---Was she veil'd?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She was.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  How couldst thou know her?
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  By the pliant grace 
                  Of the young form---the goddess step---the charm 
                  Of motion. With such port the queenly swan 
                  Glides o'er the waters. Dost thou not remember 
                  When Foscari once---
                  
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Avoid that name. Avoid it.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She's here.
                  Enter Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  And veil'd! Whence com'st thou, sister? speak. 
                  Why hast thou borne those tears and that wan face 
                  Abroad amongst the happy? Whence com'st thou?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   From one whose heart drops blood for this great grief.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Whence?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  From St. Mark's.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  The Doge! The poor old Doge!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  The Doge! It was not by the Ducal chambers 
                  That I this morning saw---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  My lord Erizzo, 
                  I seek not to deceive ye. I have seen 
                  The Doge. But 'twas another wretcheder 
                  Of whom I spake,---one who hath long to live. 
                  I come from where beneath the leaden roofs 
                  Foscari lies.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  And she can speak that name 
                  Sighingly, fondly! She can cast aside 
                  Even maiden modesty! Forgive me, friend, 
                  That trusting her I doubted thee. Approach not! 
                  Thou art contaminate.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He's innocent! 
                  Turn not away, shake me not off, as though 
                  I were some loathed reptile. Cosmo! Brother! 
                  We two are left alone in the wide world, 
                  And I, that sate upon that rainbow throne 
                  Of happiness, I am fallen, fallen.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What would'st thou? 
                  
                  How may I comfort thee? Sweet gentle soul, 
                   Her tears are daggers. Speak.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And thou wilt listen?
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Patient as infancy.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He goes to-night; 
                  And I---nay, start not.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  What of thee?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  And I--- 
                  We were betroth'd; he goes a sentenc'd wretch--- 
                  But innocent, most innocent! He goes 
                  To scorn, to exile, and to misery, 
                  And I---I came to say farewell to thee 
                  My brother---I go with him.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She raves. 
                  Look how she trembles; she is overwatched; 
                  This is a frenzy.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Sir, I am not mad; 
                  I'm a Donato born, and drank in courage 
                  Even with my mother's milk. What if I shake! 
                  Within this trembling frame there is a heart 
                  As firm as thine. Speak to me ere we part, 
                  My brother! Speak to me, whatever words, 
                  However bitter! Any thing but silence, 
                  Cold withering silence!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Sister!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                   Bless thee, bless thee, 
                  For that kind word!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  My sister, sit thee down.--- 
                  Misery hath brought her to this pass.---Camilla, 
                  We had a father once:---he's slain. Would'st thou 
                  Join this white hand, which he so lov'd to mould 
                  Within his own, the soft and dimpled hand, 
                  With one---
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh pure as thine! Believe it, Cosmo; 
                  Pure as thine own!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  We have no father now, 
                  And we should love each other. Stay with me. 
                  I am no tyrant-brother: I'll not force 
                  Thy blooming beauty to some old man's bed 
                  For high alliance; I'll not plunge thy youth 
                  Into that living tomb where the cold nun 
                  Chants daily requiems, that thy dower may swell 
                  My coffers; I but ask of thee to stay 
                  With me in thy dear Venice, thy dear home, 
                  Thy mistress, mine. I'll be to thee, Camilla, 
                  A father, brother, lover. Stay with me. 
                  I will be very kind to thee.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh cruel! 
                  This kindness is the rack.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I would but save thee 
                   From exile, penury, shame---
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He said so.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  He!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Aye, he urg'd all that thou canst say against 
                  Himself and me---in vain. My heart is firm. 
                  I go. But love me still, oh love me still 
                  My brother!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Listen.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He said all.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla! 
                  I'd save thee from a crime, a damning crime--- 
                  Did he say that? From such a parricide, 
                  Such unimagin'd sin---I tell thee, girl, 
                  The Roman harlot, she the infamous 
                  That crush'd her father with her chariot wheels, 
                  She'll be forgotten in thy monstrous guilt, 
                  Whitened by thy black shame.
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Oh father, father, 
                  I call upon thee! Look on me from heav'n, 
                  Search my whole soul---'tis white. Oh when some tale 
                  Of woman's truth brought tears into my eyes, 
                  How often hath he said---Be thou, too, faithful 
                  In weal or woe! And now---farewell! farewell! 
                  Cosmo, my heart is breaking---Say farewell, 
                  Only farewell!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   Stay with me.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  No.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Then go, 
                  Outcast of earth and heaven, of God and man! 
                  Abandon'd, spurn'd, abhorr'd, accurst! Go forth 
                  A murderer's bride---worse! worse! What impious priest 
                  Will dare profane the holy words that join 
                  The pure of heart and hand for ye, for ye, 
                  The parricides---Oh that she had but died 
                  Innocent in her childhood.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  One day, brother, 
                  Thou'lt grieve for this. Now bless thee!
                  Exit Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Stay!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  She's gone.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Why let her go, foul stain upon our house! 
                  She was his daughter still, and yesterday 
                  An Angel! And he loved her and she him 
                  With such a dotage! 'Twas a sight to see 
                  How ere the pretty babe could speak its will, 
                  The chubby hands would cling and fix themselves 
                  Round its dear father's neck. Mother, or nurse, 
                  Or I, the elder child that played with her 
                  Full half the day, were nothing if she caught 
                  One glimpse of that dear father.
                  
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Now she'll hang 
                   Around his murderer's neck.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Do ye all forget. 
                  That I'm her brother? Ho, Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  'Twill be 
                  A triumph 'mid their shame to these misproud 
                  Revengeful Foscari to bear off thus 
                  The glory of your house.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  I'll rescue her. 
                  Where is she? Is she gone? What ho, Camilla! 
                  I'll follow her to the end of the earth. The laws 
                  Give me a father's power. I'll save her yet. 
                  Camilla! Ho, Camilla!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  You must seek her 
                  With him. The time draws near. 
                  Cosmo rushes out.
                  Now, Foscari, 
                  I have thee at my feet.
               
               Exit.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               The Sea Shore.
               Doge, Foscari, Guards.
               
                  Foscari.
                  Here then we part. Those Guards---send them away, 
                  Let them not listen to the last faint word, 
                  Nor gaze on the last lingering look Why doubt'st thou? 
                  Fear me not---I'll be a true prisoner. 
                  I am a Foscari still, bound by one chain, 
                  Honour. Send them away.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Leave us.
               
               Exeunt Guards.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Aye, now 
                  My soul is free again. That tallest slave 
                  Stood brushing against my vest---he with the hard 
                  Cold stony eyes---and I---let not that man 
                  Go with me.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He shall not.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  How can I waste 
                  A word on such a reptile! I'd a world 
                  Of sad and loving things to say to thee, 
                  But there's a weight just here---Oh father! father! 
                  I thought to have been a comfort to thy age, 
                  But I was born to spread a desolation 
                  On all I love.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I would not change my son, 
                  Banished although he be, with the proudest sire 
                  In Christendom. But we must part. These men 
                  Are merciless.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                   Implore no grace of them. 
                  And yet to leave this brave and tender heart 
                  To wither in its princely solitude, 
                  Friendless, companionless.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Age hath one friend, 
                  One sure friend---Death.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh I shall not be by 
                  To close thine eyes or kneel beside thy couch, 
                  Or gather from thy lips the last fond sound 
                  Of blessing or of pardon. Bless me now, 
                  Parting is dying.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Bless thee, my dear son. 
                  Enter Camilla.
                  Camilla!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Bless her too. She is thy daughter; 
                  She goes with me to exile.
                  
               
               
                  Doge.
                  She is blest 
                  In her high constancy. Beloved child 
                  Thy virtuous love hath softened the sharp pang 
                  Of this dread hour.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Father! My only Father! 
                  Foscari, the bark awaits us.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  What, already?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  All is prepared.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I should have told thee so; 
                  But when I would have said, Go! go! my tongue 
                   Clave to my mouth.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Already! Write to me 
                  Often. Is that forbidden? Yet the Doge 
                  May ask my Candiote jailer if his prisoner 
                  Be strictly kept. Then I shall sometimes see, 
                  For surely he will shew it me, thy name, 
                  Thy writing, something thou hast touched. 'Twill be 
                  A comfort.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I will write to thee.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  And think 
                  Of me when the pale moon lets fall her cold 
                  And patient light upon the Adrian wave 
                  That sighs and trembles. Think of me then.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Always. 
                  By sun, or moon, or star; in the bright day 
                  In the night's darkness, but one single thought 
                  Will dwell in my old heart---My banished son.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Alas! Francesco, why wilt thou prolong 
                  This useless agony?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  He hath not said 
                  Farewell. One last embrace, one blessing more--- 
                  The last!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  What step is that? 
                  
                  Enter Zeno.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  I crave your pardon: 
                  But I must pray the Doge to come with me 
                   Straight to the Senate. 'Tis an earnest business. 
                  I do beseech your Highness. Leave him, Foscari! 
                  Cling not together as your very souls 
                  Were interlaced. The Senate, Doge, demands thee.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  The Senate! What! hath he another son 
                  To try, to torture, to condemn? Hath he 
                  Another heart to break? Yet go. For once 
                  Their cruelty is mercy. Go.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Whilst still 
                  These eyes may gaze on thee! Ere yonder cloud 
                  Shall pass across the sun, a darker cloud 
                  Will wrap me in its blackness; then the throne, 
                  The judgment seat, the grave---no matter where 
                  The old man rests his bones!---One dim eclipse 
                  Will shadow all---but now---say to the senate 
                  That at their bidding I am sending forth 
                  My son to exile.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Go! go!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Doge, thy duty, 
                  Thy princely duty calls thee.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  To that word, 
                  Which was to me a god, have I not offered 
                  My child upon the altar? Is the sacrifice 
                  Still incomplete? Farewell! farewell!
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Francesco, 
                   Embark not till ye hear from me.---My lord, 
                  This way.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  I pray you pardon me---I'm old--- 
                  I'm very old.
                  Exeunt Doge and Zeno
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Nay sit not shivering there 
                  Upon the ground. Hast thou no word for me, 
                  
                  Francesco?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Is he gone? Quite gone? For ever?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Take comfort.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Is he gone? I did not say 
                  Farewell, nor God be with thee! When men part 
                  From common friends for a slight summer voyage 
                  They cry Heaven speed thee! and I could not say 
                  Farewell to my dear father, nor call down 
                  One benison on that white reverend head 
                  Which I shall never see again. There breathes not 
                  A wretch so curst as I.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Foscari, the lips 
                  That I have kissed are cold.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Oh bruised flower, 
                  Whose very wounds do shed an odorous balm! 
                  My gentle comforter! could I forget 
                  Thy misery! Forgive me.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  I have left 
                  His bier, his bloody bier.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                   Aye, there it is! 
                  Fortune, and friends, and home, to fly from them 
                  Were nothing---but she leaves the unburied corse 
                  Of her dead father, the dear privilege 
                  To sit and watch till the last hour, to strew 
                  His body with sweet flowers like a bank in spring 
                  Making death beautiful, to follow him 
                  To his cold bed, and drop slow heavy tears 
                  To the bell's knolling. She leaves grief to go 
                  With me, whom the world calls---Oh matchless love, 
                  Life could not pay thee! Matchless, matchless love!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He, that blest spirit, knows thy innocence: 
                  And I---I never doubted.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Matchless love! 
                  We'll never part, we'll live and die together, 
                  
                  There is a comfort in the word. Camilla, 
                  Where are the guards, the ship? My heart beats high 
                  At thy exceeding truth. We shall set forth 
                  As to a victory.
                  Enter Cosmo, and Erizzo.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  She's here! She's here. 
                  Move not a step. Dare not to stir. Camilla, 
                  Follow me.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Who is he that dares obstruct 
                  The mandate of the Senate? I'm an exile 
                  Travelling to banishment. All Venice knows 
                   The piteous story of the Doge's son 
                  Condemned by his own father, and of her 
                  His true and faithful love. Now leave us, Sir; 
                  Let us depart in peace.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Murderer! Ravisher! 
                  I seek my sister.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  She stands there. Ask her 
                  Whom she will follow.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He knows well. Francesco, 
                  The whole world shall not part us.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Mine! Mine own! 
                  My very own! I've lost wealth, country, home, 
                  Fame, friends, and father; I have nothing left 
                  Save thee, my dear one; but with thee I'm rich, 
                  And great, and happy. Now let us go forth 
                  Into our banishment. Give me thy hand, 
                  My wife.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Camilla, I command thee stay--- 
                  The laws of Venice give to me a power 
                  Absolute as a father's. Loose her, Sir. 
                  Let go her hand. I warn ye part. They'll drive me 
                  
                  Into a madness. If thou be a man 
                  Let's end this quarrel bravely.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Heed him not!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Calm thee! He is thy brother.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                   I disclaim her.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Tremble not so! I am unarmed, Camilla.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Dost hold her as a shield before thy breast? 
                  Dost palter with me, coward?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  (breaking from Camilla)
                  Off!---A sword! 
                  A sword for charity!
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Help! Help! The Doge! 
                  The guard! Stay with them! Part them! Leave them not! 
                  Hold them asunder, Count, and in my prayers 
                  Thou shalt be sainted! Help.
                  Camilla rushes out.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Give me a sword!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Aye his or mine. I am so strongly armed 
                  In my most righteous cause. I would encounter 
                  A mailed warrior with a willow wand.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  There is my weapon.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Why thou wast my foe! 
                  But this is such a bounty as might shame 
                  The princely hand of friendship. Not the blade 
                  Girt by a crowned Duke around my loins, 
                  An Emperor's gift, the day I won my spurs 
                  In the Suabian victory, not that knightly sword

                  Foscari, come on!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  I would thou wert a soldier!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Now.
                  They fight, and Foscari falls.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                   The fates 
                  Work for me.---Ha!

                  Erizzo.
                  Is he dead? 
                  
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Alas! Alas! Lift up his head.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  (behind the scene)
                  Here! Here! 
                  Canst thou not hasten. 
                  Enter Camilla and the Doge.
                  entering)
                  Foscari! He's slain! 
                  Oh bloody, bloody brother! Kill me too! 
                  Be merciful! Help!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Doth he live?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Away! 
                  Thy hands are bloody!---Help, Doge Foscari! 
                  Help Father!---The old man stands stiffening there 
                  Into a statue---He'll die first Off! Off! 
                  Wouldst kill him o'er again?---He bleeds to death! 
                  Father, it is thy blood.
               
               
                  Doge.
                  My son! My son! 
                  Who hath done this?
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  He is not dead. Support him. 
                  See how his eye-lids quiver. Foscari! 
                  'Tis I, thy wife!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Mine own!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Thanks gracious Heaven!
                  Enter Zeno and Guards.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Seize Count Erizzo, Guard. Have ye not heard--- 
                   What spectacle is this?---Know ye not, Sirs, 
                  That Foscari is guiltless, that the murderer 
                  Is found?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Hear that! I'm innocent! Hear that! 
                  The murderer is found! Nay, hold me not--- 
                  I'm well---I'm strong. Father, there is no stain 
                  In the long line of Foscari! Camilla, 
                  My Faithfullest---
               
               
                  Doge.
                  He falls. 
                  
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  There wanted this 
                  To crown the brimming cup of my despair. 
                  We should have been the happiest two, Francesco, 
                  Since the first pair in Paradise---but he 
                  That was my brother---
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Peace. Who slew Donato?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Celso, bribed by Erizzo to destroy 
                  Francesco Foscari by Donato crossed 
                  Slew him, and aided by the sword and cloak 
                  Dropped by Francesco, cast this deed of horror 
                  On the most innocent.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Hath he confessed?
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  All. Seize Erizzo, bind him.
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  There's no need. 
                  The work is done, well done---Signor Donato, 
                  I thank thee still for that---and such revenge 
                   Is cheaply bought with life.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Oh, damned viper!
               
               
                  Erizzo.
                  Aye! Do ye know me? Not a man of ye 
                  But is my tool or victim. I'm your master. 
                  This was my aim when old Donato died, 
                  And but that Celso dared not cope with Foscari 
                  And sought to catch him in a subtler springe 
                  I had been now your Doge. And I am more. 
                  I am your master, Sirs. Look where he lies 
                  The towering Foscari, who yesterday 
                  Stood statelier than the marble gods of Rome 
                  In their proud beauty. Hearken! It is mute, 
                  The tongue which darted words of fiery scorn 
                  And cold contempt, and bitter pardon---dared 
                  To hurl on me fierce pardon! Ha! he shivers! 
                  His stout limbs writhe! The insect that is born 
                  And dies within an hour would not change lives 
                  With Foscari. I am content. For thee 
                  
                  I have a tenfold curse. Long be thy reign, 
                  Great Doge of Venice!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Aye, I am the Doge; 
                  Lead him to instant death. 
                  Exit Erizzo guarded.
                  My son!
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  'Tis I 
                  That am the only murderer of the earth--- 
                   I that slew him. Bring racks and axes---
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Live! 
                  I pardon thee. He pardons thee. Live, Cosmo; 
                  It is thy Prince's last behest. I've been 
                  O'erlong a crowned slave. Go! dross to dross. 
                  Flinging off the Ducal Bonnet.
                  And bruise the stones of Venice! Tell the senate 
                  There lies their diadem. Now I am free! 
                  Now I may grieve and pity like a man! 
                  May weep, and groan, and die! My heart may burst 
                  Now! Start not, Zeno---Didst thou never hear 
                  Of a broken heart? Look there.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  Hush! He revives.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  My Foscari!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Camilla! Is't Camilla? 
                  Is she not weeping? What canst thou weep now 
                  When honour is redeemed and a bright name? 
                  Why there should be no tear in all the world; 
                  Gladness is come from Heaven.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Death! Death!
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  This joy 
                  Is life. Who talked of death? I cannot die 
                  In such a happiness. I'm well.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  He sinks; 
                  Support him.
               
               
                  Cosmo.
                  Is he dead? 
                  
               
               
                  Doge.
                   Beloved son. 
                  How art thou?
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Strong at heart. What are those shapes 
                  That hover round us? There! There! There!
               
               
                  Doge.
                  Thy friends.
               
               
                  Foscari.
                  Friends! Have they heard that I am innocent? 
                  That I'm no murderer? That I do not shame 
                  My father's glory? Let it be proclaimed---
                  Tell Venice---tell---
                  dies.
               
               
                  Zeno.
                  He's gone.
               
               
                  Camilla.
                  Mine! Still mine own! 
                  Bury me with him! He is mine.
               
               THE END.
