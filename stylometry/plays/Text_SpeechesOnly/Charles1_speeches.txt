Welcome to London,Ireton! dearly welcomeTo fair Whitehall!
                     Harrison!
                     Pride!Where loitersThe valiant General?He alighted with usThree hours agone.What, three hours here, and stillIn harness! Know ye not your coat of mailIs out of date? Go, doff your armour quick,Provide ye civil suits, grave civil suits,Sad reverend civil suits.What mean'st thou?SeekMeaning of Harry Marten! Tush! Where
                     tarriesThe piousCromwell?He is busied stillDisposing the tired soldiery.DisbandingWill be his business soon. The lubbard people,And the smug citizens, are grown awearyOf this rough war. Ye must learn gentler tradesIf ye would thrive. Peace is the cry, my masters; Peace and the King!The Newport treaty speeds;So far is sure.But we bring victory,To the good cause. Cromwell hath passed careeringFrom hold to hold, sweeping as with a besom
                  The foul malignants from the land. The
                        North
                  Is ours from sea to sea.'Tis a brave leader;But peace is ever the best victory.In good time comes the General. Valiant Cromwell
                  Thy praise was on our lips.Not mine! not mine!Praise to the Lord of Hosts, whose mighty shieldBucklered us in the battle, whose right armStrengthened us when we smote! Praise to the Lord!For his poor instruments, the meanest soldierDoth his great duty; we no more. My masters,Have ye no news astir? News, the prime stapleOf yonder tattling city?Aye; the worstIs that the Commons grow from day to dayMore doubtful of the army, more possessedBy canting presbyters.Name not the Commons,A jealous crew, whose envious hate descends'Twixt every pause of fear on us their loathedDespised defenders. Were there but one headTo the whole army, they would turn to truthAn elder tyrant's wish, and chop it off.Despots who prate of liberty!—Worse! worse!A godless yet intolerent crew, who rearO'er the down-fallen Church that blacker idolA conscience-fettering Presbytery.Sir,They shall be quelled. Power, howsoever called,Is still the subtlest snare the Tempter weavesFor man's frail sinful soul. Save me from power!Grant me to follow still, a lowly soldierIn the great cause! The Commons shall be
                     quelled.What other news?The best is that the King
                  And the Commissioners draw near a godlyAnd salutary peace. The King hath bentHis will in a wise humbleness; and now—I joy to hear thee say so. What! the LordHath turned his heart, and he hath yielded upHis haughtyprelates, his ill councillors,The popish mummery of his chapel?Nay,Not yet; but he hath promised.Promised! OhThe King hath promised!Well?And ye believe?Would'st have us doubters?In good sooth, not I!Believe who can! yet ere ye set him freeLook to the stuffing of his saddle, searchThe waste leaves of his prayer-book, lest ye findSome vow to Henrietta, some shrewd
                     protest,Some antedated scroll to throw the shadowOf a plain lie before his words. Search! search!It is a prudent King, that casts about himTo rid him of his enemies. Search, I say.Why,Cromwell, thou art bitter.Heaven forfend!I liked Charles Stuart well. I am of the
                     foolsWhom Habit counts amidst her slaves; that love,For old acquaintance sake, each long-known pestAnd close familiar evil. I liked him well;The better that his proud disgracious speechSeemed to my plain and downright simplenessAs honest as mine own. Ye all rememberWhat friends we were at Holmby. Harrison
                  And e'en my loving kinsman deemed I waxedFaint in the cause. But rightly it is writtenIn the one Holy Book, Put not thy trustIn Princes.Yet is he in 
                     Carisbooke
                  A present danger. Round yon prison isle
                  Lurk spies and plots and treasons. Every breezeComes pregnant with quick rumours; every earIs bent to listen; every eye is turnedOn those grey walls.I grant ye. But astir,Free as the breeze to traverse sea and land,Creep in our councils, sweep across our camps,Were the King harmless then? Yet thou art right;He's dangerous in Carisbrooke.Dismiss him;Send him abroad unkinged; or drive him forthAs Amaziah.
                  Ha! And they slew him!What, send him to seek succour in each court,From papal Rome to savage
                     Muscovy,Till he shall burst on us in triumph, heading
                     Europe's great armament.Wert thou a soldier,And in this cause, thou would'st cry Welcome, Marten,To such an armament.With His great help.Aye, with His help and in this cause, if unionDwelt in the land. But this is idle talk.The King is dangerous; dangerous on the throne,Dangerous in prison, dangerous abroad,At home and everywhere. Yet this is idle.We must abide the
                     Commons' treaty.
                  WhereforeLifts not the army the strong hand of
                     powerOver these stiff-necked rulers? Put them down.Tread out the firebrands.Rather move the Commons
                  To bring the King to trial.Who said that?'Twas bravely spoken.Who said that?The wordsSounded like treason.Sir, had we met hereTo compass such intent, the very thoughtHad been a treason. But the words fell straightMidst our unconscious hearts, unprompted, quick,Startling even him who spake them—-like the fireThat it the Burning Bush. A sign from Heaven!Direct from Heaven! A comfortable lightTo our benighted spirits! As I wrestled
                     In prayer this morning, when I would have criedFor mercy on Charles Stuart, my parched
                     tongueClave to my mouth. A token from on high!A star lit up to guide us!Yet the Commons
                  Will scarcely echo this rapt strain. The King
                  Hath friends amongst us.Fear not. He who sentThis impulse on his servants will know howTo turn all hearts.Ye will not slay the King?Life hangs not on our lips. Yet surely, Sir,I hope to spare him. Friends, we must not sleepOver such stirring business. Downes, go
                     thouFor Bradshaw, that resolved and learned and wiseAnd godly law-man. Thou art like to find himAt the Guildhall. Say we would speak
                     with him.
                     Harrison!—Downes went
                     forth as one who loves notHis errand—Lacks he zeal? 'Tis a brave soldier,And yet—Follow him, Marten; and returnWith Bradshaw hither. We shall need
                     thy counsel.Delay not.—
                     Harrison! thou truest soldierOf the good cause, to thee we trust the chargeOf guarding our great prisoner. Make thee readyFor a swift journey. I'll confer with theeAlone afore thou goest.Should I not seeThe General?Wherefore? Hence.Nay, Colonel, go not!I'd speak with thee, good Colonel. Rest thee, son,I'd speak with this good Colonel.I attendYour Excellency's pleasure.Aye, the lightMercurial Harry Marten said but sooth;They are unripe for this great charge. It shall be—And yet—What is the hour?Upon the strokeOf one.He listens not. Look how he searchesThe weather with unseeing eyes.'Tis stormy.Nay a bright day.He hears not.Sweep them off,And the whole game is ours! But—Which way blowsThe wind?Right from the south.It must be, shall be.
                     Ireton, I gave thee yesterday a scrollOf the malignants in the Commons>—Hark ye!The Commons, our great masters! If Charles
                        Stuart
                  Have friends in England, he will find them there'Mid those self-seekers.Wherefore not arraignThe King before the Council?.
                     Sir, we needThe Commons' name. I would not that our justAnd righteous cause lacked any form of lawTo startle tender consciences. I have thoughtAfore of this. Didst never see the thrasherWinnow the chaff from the full grain? Good Colonel,Thyself shalt play the husbandman to cleanseThis sample of foul corn. Take yonder scroll,And with a troop of horse, go post thyselfBeside the Commons' door, and seize each manWhose name stains that white parchment. Treat all well,But let none enter.And my warrant?Sir,My word. If any question, say the General—
                     Lord Fairfax?
                  Aye, the good Lord GeneralShall hear of thy good service. Fear it not.Myself shall tell him. Thy good service, dearerThan half a dozen battles; better worthAnd richlier guerdoned. Haste! Lord Grey of
                        Groby
                  Will aid thee to detect the knaves. Away!Full many a goodly manor shall change mastersTo-morrow 'fore the sequestrators.So!That work will be well done.I loathe myselfThat I employ the mercenary tool;But we are in our great aims justified,Our high and holy purpose. Saints and prophetsHave used uncleanly instruments. Good son,Keep between Fairfaxand these men. The weak
                     Wife-ridden faintling would demur and dally,
                     And pause at every step, and then draw back,Unapt for good or ill. He must know nought.What make ye here again?Dost thou not hear?A mutiny amongst the soldiers.Nay,But half a score malignants, who would fainStir up the soldiery.And they?They listen,But move not.Seize the traitors. Shoot them dead;If any murmur, still them too. Let deathFollow offence as closely as the soundOf the harquebuss the flash. Art thou not gone?What stops thee?Be more merciful.Why thisIs mercy. If thou saw'st one, match in handApproach a mine hollowed beneath some richAnd populous town, would'st strike him down at once,Or wait till he had fired the train.At once!At once!Well?—Go thou too, fair son! away!I'll follow on the instant. Look I findThe guilty quiet.We have been too easyAnd fostered malcontents. Yet this swift vengeance
                     Will strike a wholesome terror, and the echoMay reach to higher miscreants. Good Colonel,Thou loiterest overlong. Go, block the doorAnd let none pass. Be sure thou let none pass.I must to yon poor traitors. Let none pass.Herbert!My liege.Put up my book. I waitThe grave Commissioners, and to be seen
                     Poring o'er Shakespeare's page—Oh heinous sin!Inexpiable deadly sin!Your GraceSpeaks cheerily.Why I have fed my thoughtsOn the sweet woodland tale, the lovely taleOf 
                        
                           Ardenne
                           Arden
                        
                        Forest, till the peaceful end,The gentle comfortable end, hath
                     bathedMy very heart in sunshine. We are hereBanished as the old Duke, and friends come round,And foes relent, and calm Forgiveness hangs,An Angel, in the air, to drop her balmOn all our wounds. I thank thee, royal spirit,Thrice princely poet, from whose lightest sceneKings may draw comfort. Take yon sprig of bayAnd lay between the leaves. I marvel muchWhere loiter the Commissioners.Your GraceHath vanquished them so often that they creepFearfully to the field—a beaten foe.
                     Nay, we are near agreed. I have granted moreThan they durst think for. They set forth to dayBearing my answer to the Commons. LookTo see a sudden peace. Many will deemI have yielded overmuch; but I keep quickThe roots of kingly power, albeit the boughsBe shrewdly lopt. And then to see againMy wife, my children, to reward my poorAnd faithful servants, to walk free, to reign!Look to see sudden peace.Yet, Sire—forgive my fear!—would thou hadst ta'enThe proffered means of safety, had escapedThis Island prison!What! when I had pledgedMy word, my royal word! Fie! fie! good Herbert;Better, if danger were, a thousand foldPerish even here than forfeit that great bondOf honour, a King's word. Fie! fie! Yet soothThou mean'st me kindly, Herbert. Ha, the Sea,That day and night hath chased so angrily,Breaking around us with so wild a coil,An elemental warder, smiles again,Merrily dancing in the cold keen lightOf the bright wintery Sun. We shall have boatsFrom England.One hath landed, Sire.And theyMay bear my message without pause. Who comes?May't please you, Sire, the high Commissioners
                  Crave audience of your Majesty.Admit them.See, Vane hath lost his
                           frown! We shall have peace.Good morrow my good Lord of Salisbury!Lord Say, Sir Harry Vane, and gentles all,A fair good morrow. The sun smiles at lastUpon our meeting.Sunshine after storm;A happy omen, Sire, a type of peace.Yet clouds are gathering.Tush! the noon-day sunWill overcome them.Cease this heathenish talkOf omens. Hath your grace prepared your answerTo the proposals of the Commons?ReachYon paper Herbert.
                     Set ye forth to-day?With the next tide.So speed ye wind and wave,And send ye swiftly hence, and swiftlier backBlest messengers of peace, winged like the dove That bore the olive token. Take my answer,A frank compliance with each articleSave twain, save only twain.And they—I pray theeBe wholly gracious, Sire! Peril not thusYour country's weal, your freedom, and your crown,By timeless reservation.I have yieldedPower and prerogative, and state and wealthFor my dear country. All that was mine ownAll that was mine to give, I freely gave;That I withhold is of the conscience. Look
                     On these white hairs, and think if one so signedMarked for the grave, may for the vain respectOf crowns or kingdoms offer up his friendsOr his old worship. Mark me: I'll not yieldA man of that devoted seven, nor bateA word of my accustomed prayer, to saveMy lips from cankering fetters, or win backThat velvet prison, a throne. No more of this.Bear ye the treaty, Sirs; and use but halfThat goodly gift of eloquence for meThat ye to me have shown, and be but heardWith half the grace, and we shall meet full soon& we shall meet full soon,Subject and King, in peace, in blessed peace.—Whoso asks entrance with so wild a din?Give him admittance quickly.Yet, my liege,For these seven cavaliers—No more! No more!Thou hast my answer.—By the iron treadA soldier.
                     Harrison! What brings
                     thee hither?A sad and solemn message to your prisoner.Speak out thy tidings. Speak thine errand, Sir.I am strong-hearted. Sovran privilegeOf them that tower so high!—Strong as yon eagleThat nests among the cliffs. I have borne loadsThat would have sunk a meaner man in gulphsOf deep despair. Thine errand. Stop! Who sent thee?The CommonsNow thine errand.To demand
                     The body of Charles Stuart,
                     sometime KingOf England—Sometime King?Whom I attachOf treason.Treason and the King! Off, Sir!I warn thee touch me not. Some natures feelA shuddering loathing of cold-blooded worms,Snakes, aspics, vipers, toads—my flesh doth creepAnd shiver if the reptile man approachToo closely. Show thy warrant.Look you, Sir,The warrant be obeyed.Dost thou not see The master hand of Cromwell in this deed? Where is the General?Come victorious home—Know'st thou not that?—to lend his pious aidTo our great work.But thou art from the Commons, Not from the Council,—sure thou saidst the Commons?And they were earnest for the treaty.Aye,But in that goodly field grew tares, rank tares,Which have been weeded out: stiffpresbyters,Bitter malignants, and those sons of wrathWho falter in the better path— dead boughsUpon a noble tree. Some fifty horseSwept off the rubbish.But the men are safe? Even as thyself.Now, sir, hast thou enoughStudied yon parchment?Treason! to arraignA crowned King of treason! I am here
                     Treating with these same Commons on the faith, The general faith of nations. I appealTo ye, my foes; to thee, my gaoler. What!Stand ye all mute? high lords and learned lawmen,And reverend ministers? Ye had glib tonguesFor subtle argument, and treasonous craft,And cobweb sophistry. Have ye no wordFor faith, for honour? not one word? Shame! shame!We are the Commons'
                     servants, and must needsObey their mandates.Yet with grief of heart—Silence!Aye, silence! Sir, I thank thee yetThat sparest me that sharpest injuryA traitor's pity. For that gentle deedI yield me gently to thy hands. Lead onWhere'er thou wilt; I follow.Straight to London. To bide thy trial.What! will they dare that?Doth not the very thought, the very wordAppal the rebels? Trial! When we meetConfronted in that regal Hall, the KingAnd his revolted subjects, whoso thenShall be the Judge? The King. Whoso make inquest,Whoso condemn, and whoso fling a pardon,A scornful pardon on your heads? The King,The King, I tell ye, Sirs. Come on! I pantTo meet these Judges. For ye, solemn mockers, Grave men of peace, deceivers or deceived,Sincere or false boots little, fare ye well! Yet give me yon vain treaty—Now, by HeavenI shame to have communed with ye!—This slight paper,That shivers at a touch, is tough and firmMated with such as ye. Bear to the Commons,Your masters, yon torn fragments, fitting type Of their divided factions!—fitting typeOf ye, men of a broken faith! Farewell!I wait thy pleasure, Sir.Soon as the day be fixed, apprize me, Sirs;The halberdiers shall wait ye.Good my lordThou wilt not leave us? When did Fairfax
                     flyA post of danger? And his honoured nameStands foremost in our roll.Sir, I am swornThe soldier of the Commons, and as soldierObey them loyally. All that ye needFor state or for defence in this sad pageantOur camp shall furnish. Save their General,You may command the army. For this trialI like it not. I am no gownsman. Sirs,The halberdiers shall wait ye.
                     What a niceAnd peevish conscience Fairfax bears! Will
                     sendArms, horses, men, to escort the prisoner, lineThe Court, defend the judges, guard the scaffold—If so our wisdom wills—yet hold himselfContent and harmless, so his single voiceSwell not the general doom.Yet 'tis a wiseAnd noble gentleman.Tush! a good sword-blade,Keen in the field, but at the council dullAnd heavy as the scabbard.Lo! where comesOne whose bright spirit knows no dimness. Cromwell!Hear ye the news my masters? Harrison,That bold and zealous soldier of our Israel,Is here.Where is the King?The King of Kings
                  Delivers him unto us. Harrison
                  Awaits his landing. We must be preparedFor instant trial. Glad am I and proudTo greet with looks so firm and resoluteThis full and frequent council.Yet you metA great one who forsakes us.The Lord General?Why on the battle-day such loss might causeAn hour's perplexity. Now—Hark ye Sirs!Passing awhile Lord Fairfax's door I sawThe Queen.
                     In England! Didst thou see her face?No. But I knew her by the wanton curls,The mincing delicate step of pride, the gaitErect and lofty. 'Twas herself, I say,Vain Jezabel
                     !At Fairfax's gate! Alas!Poor lady!Ha! And must we watch thee too?No word of this good Sirs.Why master Cook
                  What needs this long indictment? Seems to meThou dost mistake our cause. The crime is notA trivial larceny, where some poor thiefIs fenced and hemmed in by a form of wordsIn tedious repetition, endless linksOf the strong chain of law, lest at some loopholeThe paltry wretch escape. We try a King,In the stern name of Justice. Fling asideThese cumbering subtleties, this maze of words,And in brief homely phrase, such as the soldierMay con over his watchfire, or the milk-maidWonderingly murmur as she tends her kine,Or the young boy trace in his first huge scroll,Or younger girl sew in her sampler, sayThat we arraign Charles Stuart King of EnglandFor warring on his people. Let this deedBe clear and open as beseems the menOn whom the Lord hath set his seal. BesidesThat will let loose thy stream of eloquenceIce-bound by this cold freezing plea. What says
                     Our learned President?
                     Thou art right. Thou art right.Our fair intent needs not a veil. Be sureHe shall have noble trial and speedy, suchAs may beseem a King.What is his bearing?Resolved and confident. Lately at Windsor
                  
                     Eating a Spanish melon of choice flavour,He bade his servant Herbert send the seedsTo be sowed straight at Hampton.
                  Many menPlant acorns for their successors; thisKing setsA gourd.The Prophet's gourd. We are all mortal.Sow but a grain of mustard, the green thingWhich soonest springs from death to life, and thouShalt wither ere the leaflets shoot.The KingDeems that we dare not try him.Dare not! Cromwell
                  How soon dost think—Was't not the plash of oars?Cromwell!He hears thee not. His sense rejectsAll sound save that for which with such intenseAnd passionate zeal he listens. See his cheekQuivers with expectation. Its old hueOf ruddy brown is gone.Hark! Hark! my masters!He is come! He is come! We are about to doA deed which shall draw on us
                        questioning eyesFrom the astonished nations. Men shall gazeAfeared and wondering on this spot of earth,As on a comet in the Heavens, fatalTo Kings of old. Start ye? Why at the first
                     I started, as a man who in a dreamSees indistinct and terrible grim formsOf death and danger float before his glazedAnd wondering eyes; but then as one who wakesThe inspiring light fell on me, and I sawThe guiding hand of Providence visiblyBeckoning to the great combat. We are His soldiersFollowing the Cloud by day, the Fire by night:—And shall we not be constant? We are arrayedAgainst the stiff combined embodied spiritsOf prelacy and tyranny:—Shall we notBe bold?See! See! he passes! So shall passThe oppressor from the earth. His very shadowThe very traces of his foot are gone,And the English ground is free, the English airFree, free!—All praise be to His mighty name!This is the crowning work.Another guard! The pass-word that hath served usThrough court, and gate, and hall, will fail us here;This is the immediate prison of the King.Say, Royal Madam, had we best accostYon centinel?The prison of the King!And I have lived to hear those words that pierce
                     My heart like daggers spoken familiarlyAs she would say good day or fare ye well!The prison of the King! England hath
                     beenHis prison—but this one leads—My Lady Fairfax
                  Command him to admit us.He draws nigh.Fair mistresses how won ye here? This galleryLeads to the prisoner's chambers.We would see him.Admit us.Be ye frenetic? Know ye notThat, save the Lords Commissioners none dareApproach the prisoner?Say the King.Who art thouThat speak'st with such command?Know'st thou not me?Thy General's wife.I am of Cromwell's soldiers,And own no woman's rule.Admit us, slave!I am the Queen, thy Queen, the Queen of
                        England!Make way.Stand back I say.I am a wifeSeeking her husband in his prison. Soldier,If thou have a man's heart!Here's money for thee—Admit her.I have fought in twenty fieldsA veteran of the cause. Put up your gold.And, madam, please you home!Here is my home,—My husband's prison gate. I'll live here, die here,
                     Here will I watch without as he within,Till death, the great deliverer comes to freeThe captives. This shall be my grave. Charles!Charles!Peace! Peace!I thought I heard him. Charles! myCharles!My King! My Husband!There are many chambersBetween thee and the King. I prythee hence!Madam, take patience.
                     Charles! He must be
                     deadAlready that he answers not.What meansThis clamourous din of female tongues so nearThe prison of the King? The Lady Fairfax!
                  
                     Cromwell!
                     The Queen!
                     Cromwell I hated thee,Yet open yonder door, and I'll pray for theeAll my life long. Yon churlish centinel—Did but his duty.Lead her to her husband.Be quick! Be quick!The word is Naseby.
                  On!Be quick. Be quick!Now my good Lady Fairfax,Right well beseemeth christian charityTo succour them that suffer; howsoe'erMidst strict professors it may breed some marvelThat one so famed for rigid sanctity,The gravest matron of the land should herdWith yonder woman.
                     With the Queen?A papist;A rank Idolater; a mumming masquer;A troller of lewd songs; a wanton dancer;A vain upholder of that strength of Satan
                  The playhouse. They that be so eminentAs thou will find maligners; 'tis the curseOf our poor fallen nature. Be not seenHovering about these walls. I speak in loveOf the Lord General.The Lord General,And many a godly minister, and I,Weak woman though I be, mourn that these wallsShould come between the Kingand people. PeaceHad been a holier bond.Peace! that our GeneralThe good Lord Fairfax, Captain of the guard,Should tend the popish ladies to their mass;—A high promotion! Peace! That every dungeonMay swarm with pious ministers;—forget theyTheir old oppressions? Peace! that the grave matronThe Lady Fairfax may with troubled thoughtsSit witness of lewd revels; mock and scornOf the light dames of the chamber, and the lordlingsTheir gallants;—popinjays who scoff and jeerAt the staid solemn port, the decent coif,The modest kerchief. I have heard such jeersWhen yon gay Queen hath laughed.Laughed! Hath she dared!Vain minion!And to see thee with her! ThouThat shouldst have been a Jael in this land,A Deborah, a Judith!
                  Nay, we liveUnder a milder law. Whate'er their crimesUrge not this bloody trial.Whoso saithThat the trial shall be bloody? He who readsAll hearts, He only knows how my soul yearnsToward yonder pair. I seek them now, a friend,With friendly proffers. As we reach thy coachI'll tell thee more. Come, madam!
                        Herbert!An please your Majesty.Go seekThe General.
                        Fairfax?
                        Cromwell!
                        Cromwell!
                        sayThe King commands his presence.To fore-run him,To plunge at once into this stormy seaOf griefs, to summon my great foe, to frontThe obdurate Commons, the fanatic army,Even the mock judges, they who dare to reignOver a King, to breast them all! Then trial,Or peace! Death or the crown! Rest comes with eitherTo me and England, comfortable
                              rest,After my many wanderings.
                        Henrietta!My wife, my Queen, is't thou? Is't not a dream?
                        For I have dreamed so, and awakened—HeavenShield me from such a waking! Is't a truth?Do not my tears give answer? Did that visionRain drops of joy like these?To see thee hereIs to be young and free again, again A bridegroom and a King.Ever my King!I have heard nothing like that voice of hopeSince we were parted.Wherefore dost thou pause?Why gaze on me so mournfully?Alas!Thou art pale, my Henrietta, very pale; And this dear hand that was so round and fairIs thin and wan—Oh very wan!'Twas piningFor thee that made it so. Think on the cause,And thou'lt not mourn its beauty.And this grief,Will kill her! Joined to any other manShe might have lived on in her lovelinessFor half an age. She's mine, and she will die.Oh this is a sad meeting! I have longedHave prayed to see thee—now—Would thou wast safeIn France again, my dear one!Say not so.I bring thee comfort, safety. Holland, France,Are firmly with thee; save the army, allThis rebel England
                        is thine own; and e'enAmid the Army
                        some the greatest, some That call themselves thy judges. 'Tis the turn Of fate; the reflux of the tide.Forget not
                        That I am a prisoner, sweet-one; a foredoomedDiscrowned prisoner. As erewhile I passedSadly along, a soldier in his moodSpat on me: none rebuked him; none cried shame;None cleft the coward to the earth.Oh traitors!Oh sacrilegious rebels! Let my lipsWipe off that scorn. My Charles, thou shalt resumeThy state, shalt sit enthroned, a judge, a King,Even in the solemn 
                           Hall   
                     , the lofty seatOf their predestined treason. For thy lifeIt is assured—Lord
                           Broghilland a bandOf faithful Cavaliers—But thou shalt reign.Dost thou remember Cromwell? Ere thou quitted'st
                        England he was most like the delving wormHypocrisy; that slough is cast, and nowHis strong and shining wings soar high in airAs proud ambition. First demand of himWhat King shall reign.He is my trust.Hast seen him?He sent me to thee now.Ha, wherefore! But I've learned to trust in noughtSave Heaven. Since thou art here I am contentTo live and reign, but all in honour. I'll Renounce no creed, resign no friend, abandonNo right or liberty of this abusedMisguided people; no nor bate one jotOf the old prerogative, my
                        
                        privilege,The right divine of Kings. Death were to meAs welcome as his pleasant evening restTo the poor way-worn traveller;—And yet 
                        I fain would live for thee—Cheer up, fair wife!—Would live for love and thee. Hast seen thy
                           children?Not yet. They say Elizabeth, whose faceEven when a little child resembled thine,To wonder, hath pined after thee, and fedHer love by thinking on thee, till she hath stolenUnconsciously thy mien and tone and wordsOf patient pensiveness; a dignityOf youthful sorrow, beautiful and sad.Poor child! poor child! a woeful heritage!When I have gazed on the sweet seriousnessOf her young beauty, I have pictured herIn the bright May of life, a Queenly bride,Standing afore the altar with that lookRegal and calm, and pure as the azure skies
                        Of Paradise ere tears were born. Now—Cromwell!Did'st thou desire my presence?I sent for theeTo bear my message to thy comrades.Sir,I wait thy pleasure. I would welcome theeUnto this goodly city—Doth the gaolerWelcome his prisoner? I am Charles Stuart,And thou—Now shame on this rebellious blood!I thought that it was disciplined and schooledInto proud patience. Let me not appearDiscourteous—Sir, the King is bounden to thee!Now hear mine errand.Tush, hear me!The Queen!Fie! doff this strangeness, when it was thyselfThat sent me hither! Cast aside the smoothObedient looks which hide thy thoughts. Be plainAnd honest,Cromwell.I have ever been so.Open in speech and heart, even as myselfWhen I, thy Queen, hold out the hand of peaceAnd amity, and bid thee say what titleThe King shall give to his great General.None.Thou bad'st me answer plainly.Yet thou wast Ambitious once.Grant that I were,—as wellI trust I had more grace,—but say I were so,Think'st thou not there be homely names which soundAs sweetly in men's ears? which shall outliveA thousand titles in that book of fame,History? All praise be to the Lord I am notAmbitious.Chuse thine office. Keep the nameThy sword hath rendered famous. Be Lord Vicar;Be Captain of the Guard; forbid this suit—Thou can'st an if thou wilt—be Charles's friendAnd second man in the kingdom.Second! Speak'st thouThese tempting words to me? I nor presideO'er court or Parliament; I am not, Madam,Lord General of the
                           Army. Seek those great ones.My place is in the ranks. Would'st thou make me The second in the kingdom? Seek those great ones.The second!Thou, and well thou know'st it, Cromwell, Art the main prop of this rebellion! General,Lord President, what are they but thy tools,Thy puppets, moved by thy directing willAs chessmen by the skilful player. 'Tis thouThat art the master-spirit of the time,Idol of people and of army, leaderOf the fanatic Commons, judge, sole judgeOf this unrighteous cause.And she would make meThe second man of the kingdom! Thou but troublestThyself and me.Yet hear me but one word.No more of bribes!—thou bad'st me to speak plainly:Thou hast been bred in courts and deemest themOmnipotent o'er all. But I eschewThe Mammon of unrighteousness. I warn yeYe shall learn faith in one man's honestyBefore ye die.Never in thine! At Holmby
                     We trusted—Fool again—'Twas not in fear;I dread thee not. Thou dar'st not try the King.The very word stands as a double guard,A triple armour, a bright shield before him;A sacred halo plays around the headAnointed andendiademed, a dimMysterious glory. Who may dare to callFor justice on a King? Who dare to touchThe crowned and lofty head?Was it at Hardwick,Or Fotheringay,—fie on my dull brain—That the fair Queen of Scots, the
                        popish woman,The beautiful, his grandame died?A Queen,A vain and envious woman, yet a Queen,Condemned Queen
                        Mary. Ye are subjects, rebels,Ye dare not try your King; all else ye may do;All else ye have done; fought, imprisoned, chased,Aye, tracked and hunted, like that pious Henry,The last of the red-rose, whom visitingHelpless in prison, his arch enemyThe fiendish
                        Richard slew;—even as perchance—Shame on thy slanderous tongue! There lies my sword.Did'st take me for a murderer? Harken, Madam;When thou shalt speak again of Henry's death,Remember 'twas the restless shrew of Anjou
                     That drove her gentle husband to his end.Take up the sword; and, wife, I prythee peace!I yet am King enough to end these brawls.Take up thy sword! Albeit my breast be bare,And I unarmed before him, he'll not strike.That were an honest murder. There be waysStiller and darker; there be men whose craft Can doom with other tongues, with other handsCan slay. I know thee, Sir.I would not slayA sinner unprepared.Go to! I know thee.Say to the Parliament that I demandA conference Lords andCommons.Sir, the Commons
                     Will grant no conference. Thou must address theeTo the High Court of Justice, to thy judges.Oh vain and shallow treason! Have ye notThe King's High Court, the judges of the land?I own no other. Yet if they—Expect
                        Nothing of them but justice. I came to thee,As to a brother, in pure charity,In meek and Christian love, when these sharp tauntsArose betwixt us. Still I fain would save thee.Resign the crown.Never.Oh vanityOf man's proud heart! cling to that sinful toyA sound, an echo, a dim shadow, weakeningAs the true substance flies,—cling to that word,And cast away thy life!Hold Henrietta!What! Dost thou ask me for so poor a boonAs life to change fair honour? I've a son,A gallant princely boy—would'st have me yieldThe old ancestral crown, his heritage,For the small privilege to crawl awhileOn this vile earth, mated with fouler wormsThan they that sleep below? Would'st have me sellMy Kingdom for a little breath?Thy Kingdom!Thou hast not a stronghold left.I have one here.Thou know'st my answer.Yet if there be danger—Peace, dearest, peace! Is the day fixed?The day,The very hour, is set. At noon tomorrow,Heaven permitting—The decrees of HeavenBe oft to man's dark mind inscrutable:The lightning flame hath fired the straw-thatched roofOf harmless cottagers, hath rent the spireOf consecrated temples, hath struck downEven the dumb innocent oak that never liedNever rebelled, never blasphemed. A veilHangs before Heaven's high purpose. Yet when manSlays man, albeit no King, a reckoning comesA deep and awful reckoning. I'll abideThe trial.At thy peril.Hath every name been called? And every JudgeAppeared at the high summons?Good my Lord,Each one hath answered.The Lord General
                  Is wanting still.The better.How?Fair sonWe have enow of work—Doth not you cry Announce the prisoner?—enow of workFor one brief day without him.—Downes sit hereBeside me man.—We lack not waverers;Men whose long doubts would hold from rosy dawn
                     To the slow lighting of the evening starIn the clear Heaven of June. Of such as theyOne were too many. How say'st thou good Downes?Even as thou say'st.Yet 'tis a valiant General,A godly and a valiant. Ha! the prisoner!Peace! silence in the court!Ye shall have justice.My LordsCommissioners, whilst I
                     stood pausingHow fitliest to disclose our mighty plea,Dallying with phrase and form, yon eager cryShot like an arrow to the mark, laying bareThe very core of our intent. Sirs, weAre met to render justice, met to judgeIn such a cause as scarce the lucent sunThat smiles upon us from his throne hath seenSince light was born. We sit to judge a KingArraigned by his own people; to make inquestInto the innocent blood which hath been spilledLike water; into crime and tyranny,Treason and murder. Look that we be pureMy brethren! that we cast from out our heartsAll blinding passions: Fear that blinks and tremblesAt shadows ere they come; Pride that walks dazzledIn the light of her vainglory; feeble PityWhose sight is quenched in tears; and grim RevengeHer fierce eyes sealed with gore. Look that we chase
                     Each frail affection, each fond hidden sin, Each meaner virtue from our hearts, and clingTo Justice, only Justice. Now for thee
                     Charles Stuart King
                     of England: Thou art hereTo render compt of awful crimes, of treasonConspiracy and murder. Answer!FirstMay it please you hear the charge?Stop! Who are yeThat dare to question me?Thy Judges.SayMy subjects. I am a King whom none may judge On earth. Who sent ye here?The Commons.What!Be there no traitors, no conspiratorsNo murderers save Kings, that they dare callStern justice down from Heaven? Sir I fling backThe charge upon their heads, the guilt, the shame,The eternal infamy,—on them who sowedThe tares of hate in fields of love; who armedBrother 'gainst brother, breaking the sweet peaceOf country innocence, the holy tiesOf nature breaking, making war accurstAs that Egyptian plague the worst and lastWhen the First-born were slain. I have no answerFor them or ye. I know ye not.Be warned;Plead to the accusation.I will dieA thousand deaths, rather than by my breathGive life to this new court against the lawsAnd liberties of England.
                     Sir we know Your love of liberty andEngland. CallThe witnesses. Be they in court?They waitWithout.Send for them quickly. Once againKing wilt thou plead?Thou hast my answer, never.What fell? The breathless silence of this vastAnd crowded court gives to each common soundA startling clearness. What hath fallen?The headOf the King's staff. See how it spins and boundsAlong the floor, as hurrying to forsakeThe royal wretch its master. Now it stopsAt Cromwell's
                     feet—direct at Cromwell's feet.The toy is broken.What is the device?Some vain Idolatrous image?No, a crown;A gilded crown, a hollow glittering crown,Shaped by some quaint and cunning goldsmith. LookOn what a reed he leans, who props himselfOn such a bauble.It rolled straight to thee;—If thou wast superstitious—Pass the toyOn to the prisoner! he hath faith in omens—I—fling him back his gewgaw!
                     Master Cook
                  We wait too long.My Lord the witnesses—Call any man. Within our bleeding landThere lives not one so blest in ignoranceAs not to know this treason. None so highBut the storm overtopped him; none so lowBut the wind stooped to root him up. Call any manThe Judge upon the bench, the HalberdierThat guards the door.
                     Oliver
                     Cromwell!
                  Aye?No need to swear him. He hath ta'en already The Judges' oath.The Judges' oath, not this. Omit no form of guardian law, rememberThe life of man hangs on our lips.Smooth traitor!Lieutenant General Cromwell, wast thou presentIn the great fight of Naseby?
                  Was I present!Why I think ye know that. I was.Didst seeThe prisoner in the battle?Many times.He led his army,
                     in a better causeI should have said right gallantly. I saw himFirst in the onset, last in the retreat.That justice let me pay the King.Raised heHis banner 'gainst his people? Didst thou see
                     The royal standard in the field?My LordIt rose full in the centre of their hostFloating upon the heavy air.The arms Of England?Aye, the very lion shieldThat waved at 
                        
                           Cressi
                           Crécy
                        
                     and at 
                        
                           Azincourt
                           Agincourt
                        
                     
                  Triumphant. None may better know than I,For it so pleased the Ruler of the Field,The Almighty King of Battles, that my armStruck down the standard-bearer and restoredThe English lion to
                     the lion heartsOf England.Please you, Sir, retire. Now summon—Call not another. What I have done boldly,In the face of day and of the nation, that,Nothing repenting, nothing derogatingFrom the King's high perogative,as boldlyAs freely I avow—to you—to all men.I own ye not as Judges. Ye have powerAs pirates or land robbers o'er the wretchEntrapped within their den, a power to mockYour victim with a form of trial, to dressPlain murder in a mask of law. As JudgesI know ye not.Enough that you confess The treason—Stop! Sir, I appeal to themWhence you derive your power.The people? KingThou seest them here in us.Oh that my voiceCould reach my loyal people! That the winds
                     Could waft the echoes of this groined roofSo that each corner of the land might hear,From the fair Southern vallies to
                     the hillsOf my own native North, from the
                           bleak shoresOf the great ocean to the channeled West,Their rightful Monarch's cry. Then should ye hearFrom the universal nation, town and plain,Forest and village, the stern awful shoutOf just deliverance, mighty and prolonged,Deafening the earth and piercing Heaven, and smitingEach guilty conscience with such fear as waits On the great Judgment-Day. The wish is vain—Ah! vainer than a dream! I and my peopleAre over-mastered. Yet, Sir, I demandA conference with these masters. Tell the Commons
                  The King would speak with them.We have no powerTo stay the trial.
                  Nay, good my Lord, perchanceThe King would yield such reason as might moveThe Commons to renew the treaty. BestConfer with them.Art mad?'Tis ye are madThat urge with a remorseless haste this work Of savage butchery onward. I was madThat joined ye.This is sudden.He's our King.Our King! Have we not faced him in the fieldA thousand times? Our King! Downes, hath the
                     LordForsaken thee? Why I have seen thyselfHewing through mailed battalia, till thy swordAnd thy good arm were dyed in gore, to reach
                     Yon man. Didst mean to save him? Listen, Sir,I am thy friend. 'Tis said,—I lend no earTo slanderers, but this tale was forced upon me—'Tis said that one whose grave and honoured nameSorts ill with midnight treachery, was seenStealing from the Queen's lodging!—I'm thy friend, Thy fast friend! We oft see in this bad worldThe shadow Envy crawling stealthilyBehind fair Virtue;—I hold all for falseUnless thou prove it true;—I am thy friend!—But if the sequestrators heard this tale—Thou hast broad lands.
                        (Aloud)
                     Why do ye pause?My highAnd honouring task to plead at this great barFor lawful liberty, for suffering conscience,For the old guardians of our rights the Commons,Against the lawless fiend Prerogative,The persecuting Church, the tyrant King,Were needless now and vain. The haughty prisonerDenies your jurisdiction. I call on yeFor instant judgment.Sir, for the last timeI ask thee, wilt thou plead? Have I not answered? Your judgment, good my Lords!All ye who deem
                     Charles Stuart
                     guilty, rise!What all!Not oneIs wanting. Clerk, record him guilty.NowThe sentence!Traitors, hold!Heard'st thou a scream?'Tis the malignant wife of
                        Fairfax.No!A greater far than she.Hold, murderers!LeadYon railing woman from her seat. My Lord,Please you proceed.Traitors, here is my seat—I am the Queen;—here is my place, my state,My Lord and Sovereign,—here at thy feet.I claim it with a prouder humbler heart,A lowlier duty, a more loyal love,Than when the false and glittering diademEncircled first my brow, a queenly bride.Put me not from thee! scorn me not! I amThy wife.Oh true and faithful wife! Yet leave me,Lest the strong armour of my soul, her patience,Be melted by thy tears. Oh go! go! go!This is no place for thee.Why thou art here!Who shall divide us?Force her from him, Guards;Remove her.Tremble ye who come so nearAs but to touch her garments. Cowards! Slaves!Though the King's power be gone, yet the man's
                     strengthRemains unwithered. She's my wife; my all.None thinks to harm the Lady. Good my Lord,The hour wears fast with these slight toys.
                     I comeTo aid ye not impede. If in this landTo wear the lineal crown, maintain the laws,Uphold the insulted Church, be crimes, then IAm guilty, guiltier than your King. 'Twas IThat urged the war—ye know he loved me;—IThat prompted his bold councils; edged and whettedHis great resolves; spurred his high courage onAgainst ye, rebels! I that armed my knightAnd sent him forth to battle. Mine the crime;—Be mine the punishment! Deliver him,And lead me to the block. Pause ye? My bloodIs royal too. Within my veins the richCommingled stream of princely Medici
                  And regal Bourbon flows: 'Twill mount as high, Twill stain your axe as red, t'will feed as full Your hate of Kings.Madam, we wage no warOn women.I have warred on ye, and now—Take heed how ye release me!He is gentlePatient and kind; he can forgive. But IShall roam a frantic widow through the world,Counting each day for lost that hath not gainedAn enemy to England, a revengerOf this foul murder.Woman, peace! The sentence!
                     Yoursentence, bloody judges! As ye dealWith your anointed King the red right armOf Heaven shall avenge him: here on earthBy clinging fear and black remorse, and deathUnnatural ghastly death, and then the fire,The eternal fire, where panting murderers gasp
                     And cannot die, that deepest Hell which holdsThe Regicide.Peace! I have overlongForgotten my great office. Hence! or forceShall rid us of thy frenzy. Know'st thou notThat curses light upon the curser's head,As surely as the cloud which the sun drainsFrom the salt sea returns into the waveIn stormy gusts or plashing showers? Remove her.Oh mercy! mercy! I'll not curse; I'll beAs gentle as a babe. Ye cannot doom himWhilst I stand by. Even the hard headsman veilsHis victim's eyes before he strikes, afearedLest his heart fail. And could ye, being menNot fiends, abide a wife's keen agonyWhilst—I'll not leave thee Charles! I'll never leave theeThis is the love stronger than life, the loveOf woman. Henrietta, listen. LooseThy arms from round my neck; here is no axe;This is no scaffold. We shall meet anonUntouched, unharmed; I shall return to theeSafe, safe,—shall bide with thee. Listen my dear
                           one,Thy husband prays, thy King commands thee, Go!Go! Lead her gently, very gently.NowI am ready. Speak your doom, and quickly.Death.Thou art adjudged to die. Sirs, do ye allAccord in this just sentence?I am ready.To a grey head, aching with royal cares,The block is a kind pillow. Yet once more—
                     Silence. The Sentence is pronounced; the timeIs past. Conduct him from the Court.Not hear me!Me your anointed King! Look ye what justiceA meaner man may hope for.Why refuseHis death-speech to a prisoner? Whoso knowethWhat weight hangs on his soul. Speak on and fear not.Fear! Let the guilty fear. Feel if my pulseFlutter? Look if my cheek be faded? HarkenIf my calm breathing be not regular,Even as an infant's who hath dropt asleepUpon its mother's breast? As I lift upThis Sword, miscalled of Justice, my clear voiceHoarsens nor falters not. See, I can smileAs thinking on the axe, I draw the brightKeen edge across my hand. Fear! Would ye askWhat weight is on my soul, I tell ye none Save that I yielded once to your
                     decree, And slew my Faithfullest. Oh
                        Strafford!
                     Strafford!
                  This is a retribution!Better weep Thy sins than one just holy act.For ye My subject-judges I couldweep; for thee Beloved and lovely country. Thou wilt groan Under the tyrant Many till some boldAnd crafty soldier, one who in the fieldIs brave as the roused lion, at the CouncilWatchful and gentle as the couchant pard,The lovely spotted pard, what time she stoopsTo spring upon her prey; one who puts on,
                     To win each several soul, his several sin,A stern fanatic, a smooth hypocrite,A fierce rebublican, a coarse buffoon,Always a great bad
                        man; till he shall come,And climb the vacant throne, and fix
                     him there,A more than King. Cromwell, if such thou know'stTell him the rack would prove an easier couchThan he shall find that throne; tell him the crownOn an Usurper's brow will scorch and burn,As though the diamonded and ermined roundWere framed of glowing steel.Hath His dread wrathSmitten thee with frenzy?Tell him, for thou know'st him,That Doubt and Discord like fell harpies waitAround the Usurper's board. By night, by day, Beneath the palace roof, beneath that roofMore fair, the summer sky, fear shall appalAnd danger threaten, and all natural lovesWither and die; till on his dying bed, Old fore his time, the wretched traitor liesHeartbroken. Then, for well thou know'st him,
                     Cromwell,Bid him to think on me, and how I  fell Hewn in my strength and prime, like a proud oak,The tallest of the forest, that but shivers His glorious top and dies. Oh! thou shalt envy, In thy long agony, my fall, that shakes A kingdom but not me. He is possessed!—My good Lord President, the day wears on—Possessed of a fierce Devil!Lead him forth.Why so. Ye are warned.On to my prison, Sirs!On to my prison!Nay, my comrades,Vex not a sinner's parting hour. The wrathIs on him, Harrison!So, my lord Broghill! We are shrewdly ridOf one bold plotter. Now to strike at once,Ere fresh conspiracies—What mak'st thou here,Fair son?Sir,The Lords Commissioners refuse To sign the warrant. He'll escape us yet.Refuse! What all?No; HarrisonandBradshaw still hold firm.Too few! too few!Aye, he'll escape. They'll treat. What say the traitors?The most keep stubborn silence. Harrison
                  Is hoarse with railing.Overhot! But that'sA fault may pass for virtue. Overcold's, Your modish sin. Weakness or treachery!
                     Peters or Judases! They'll treat. They'll treat.
                     Where lies thy regiment?At Westminster.One glance of their bright swords, one stirring noteOf their war-trumpet, and these dastard Judges—I'll seek them instantly.Son, thou mistak'st. Foul shame it were here in a Christian land To govern by brute force—How many hast thou? A thousand horse.Or turn their very guardsAgainst the Judges—Be they trusty?Sir,I'll answer for them as myself.Nay, go not.No force, good Son! No force! What wouldst thou? Speak.The Colonel Harrison
                     sends me to crave Your Excellency's presence.Aye! I come. Didst meet thy fellow Robert, and the gallant Whom thou saw'st here this morning?Sir, they passed me At speed.I come. No force, good son. Remember This is a Christian land. We must keep pureThe Judgment seat. No force.At speed! Ere nowThey have crost the Thames at
                        Kew. We are quit of oneBold Cavalier. What said the Colonel?PrayedYour instant presence, and betwixt his teethMuttered "Faint craven souls!"Fie! Fie! to speak Irreverently of such great-ones. Faint And craven souls! Follow my son;thou'lt find himHeading his valiant horse. Bid him be stillTill I send to him—still as night. And nowFor ye wise Judges!Be ye all smit with palsy? Hang your armsDead at your sides, that ye refuse to signThe Warrant? Be ye turned Idolaters?Rank worshippers of Baal?They refuse not.They parley, Sir, they dally, they delay.The wiser if they did. 'Twere vantage ground,The keen axe swinging o'er his head, to treatWith yon great prisoner.Treat! Was yonder trial
                  A mummery, a stage-play, a farce? Oh blindAnd stubborn generation!The whole peopleAre struck with awe and pity. Each man's cheekIs pale; each woman's eye is wet; each childLifts up its little hands as to imploreMercy for the poor King.CaptivityAnd bondage will o'ertake them! They fall offLike the revolted Tribes. Ægyptian bondage!Wherefore so loud good Colonel? Sirs, I shameTo have held ye waiting here.A sudden cause,I pray ye believe it urgent, hindered me.Where is the warrant? Have ye left a spaceFor my poor name?Thou wilt find room enow.There!What unsigned?—Harrison!—He came hither To crave your signatures.I did my message!But these Philistines—Do ye shame to set Your names to your own deeds? Did ye not passThis solemn sentence in the face of day,Before the arraigned King, the shouting people,The majesty of Heaven?Thou dost mistake us.I crave your pardon, Sirs. I deemed ye wereThe judges, the King's judges, the elect Of England, chosen by her godly Commons
                  As wisest, boldest, best. I did mistake ye.Listen, ere thou accuse us.Listen! sign!And we will listen though your pleaded reasonOutlast Hugh Peter's sermon.Hear me first.Well.We have here Commissioners from Scotland
                  Praying our mercy on the King.They gave himInto our hands.And they are answered Sir.Thou know'st that Cromwell singly put
                     them down,As they had been young babes.The Pensionary—Pshaw!Hath sent pressing missives; EmbassiesFrom every court, are on the seas; andCharles
                  Proffers great terms.Have we not all?But heWill give a fair security, a largeAnd general amnesty. So are we freedFrom fear of after-reckoning.Master Cook
                  No wonder that a lawyer pleads to-dayAgainst his cause of yesterday—if fee'd To the height. But thou art not of us; thy partIs o'erHe will give large securities!For what?The general safetyandour own.Safety, say liberty! Securities.Many large promises! An ye will trustYe may be Earls and Marquesses, and portionThis pretty islet England as a manorAmongst ye. Shame ye not to think a bribeMight win your souls from freedom?From the Lord!Would ye desert His people? sell for gainHis cause?Hush! Hush! None thinketh to forsakeThe cause!Let Bradshaw sign. What need more namesThan the Lord President's?I am ready, Sirs,An ye will follow me. The InstrumentWere else illegal. When ye are prepared,Speak.My good masters, ye remember meOf a passage of my boyhood.Deem me notA light unmeaning trifler, recollectHow Nathan spake to David.(then aloud) Being a childNutting with other imps in the old copseAt Hinchinbroke, we saw across a wideBut shallow stream one overhanging hazel.Whose lissome stalks were weighed by the rich fruitageAlmost into the water. As we stoodEyeing the tempting boughs, a shining nutFell from its socket, dimpling wide aroundThe dark clear mirror. At that sight one boldAnd hardy urchin, with myself, no lessIn those young days a daring wight, at oncePlunged in the sparkling rivulet. It roseAbove our ancles, to our knees, half upOur thighs, and my scared comrade in the midstOf the stream turned roaring back, and gained the bankNutless and wet, amidst the scoffing shoutsOf the small people.And thou?Why I boreMy course right on , and gained the spoil. Sirs, weHave plunged kneedeep in the waters; are midwayThe stream: Will ye turn now and leave the fruitUngathered, recreants? or hold boldly onAnd win the holy prize of freedom? Give meThe warrant.
                  (signs.)So! methinks an it were notOver ambitious, and that's a sin;My homely name should stand alone to thisMost righteous scroll. Follow who list. I've leftA space for the Lord President.I'll fill it With an unworthy name.Now, swell the roll!My masters! Whither goest thou Marten? NoneShall stir till he hath signed. Thou a ripe scholar,Not write thy name! I can write mine i' the dark,And oft with my sword-point have traced in airThe viewless characters in the long hourBefore the joy of battle. Shut thine eyes,And write thy name! Anywhere! SeeNayMarten,Stand still!—See! See! how fair and clerkly! Yet This parchment is the smoother.Hold thee sureI'll pay thee, General.Why he hath marked theeLike a new ruddled sheep.I'll pay thee.Sign.Willingly; joyfully.Why so. Where goesOur zealous alderman? I deemed to seeHis name the first.He fears the City's safety,Full, as he says, of the King's friends.He fears!They be bold men who fearlessly do ownTheir fears. I dare not. Fear! Sir, didst thou comeBy water hither?No.And didst thou meetNo soldiers on thy way?Many. The streetsAre swarming with them.Were they silent?No.They called aloud for execution.Say,For justice and for execution. Marry,My Ironsides know not the new state trickTo separate the words. Well! are not theyA nearer fear? Sign boldly.They flock fast.'Tis time, for plots are weaving round about us,Like spider's nets in Autumn. But this morningI swept one web away. Lord Broghill—What!Hath he been here?Is he discovered?Sir,I have a slow-hound's scent to track a traitor.He's found and he's despatched.How?Where?To Ireland,With a commission 'gainst the rebels. 'TisAn honest soldier who deserves to fightFor the good cause. He but mistook his side;The Queen beguiled him, and the knightly soundOf lloyalty. But 'tis an honest soldier.He will prove faithful.How didst win him?How?A word of praise, a thought of fear. How do menWin traitors? Hark yeDownes! Lord Broghill leftA list of the King's friends amongst us here;—Grave seeming Roundheads, bold and zealous soldiers,High officers—I marvel not ye lookDistrustfully—one of renown, a Colonel,A Judge too!Downes, hast thou signed yonder Warrant?What was the plan?Go sign I say.—The plan!A sudden rescue, to o'erpower the guard.—Ha! Ingoldsby
                  Nay, man, if thou be questioned,Some dozen years hence, say that I forced thee, swearThy wicked kinsman held thy hand.—Aye,nowThe blank is nobly filled, and bravely! nowI know ye once again, the pious JudgesThe elect and godly of the land!Ha!—Marten
                  Haste to my son; bid him disband his force;The peril is gone by.What peril?YeThat are assembled here, should lift your voiceIn earnest thanks  for quick deliveranceFrom sudden danger. Ye knew nought of thisGreat jeopardy, nor need ye know. Give thanks,And question not. Ye are safe.Art sure of that?Did ye not hear me even now take orderThe guard should be dispersed? Question no more.Ye are so safe, that this slight parchment, Sirs,May be your shield.The deed is incomplete.It hath no date.Ah! well reminded! write
                     The Thirtieth.
                  Tomorrow? that were sudden.Why so we must be. There be plots astir,And speed is our best safety.—Thou hast signed?Thy name is here amongst us?—I must hasteTo overtake the hour. 'Tis still unsealed.Add thou my signet,Bradshaw.What intendsThe General?Question not of that. A taper!Your seals, my Lords Commissioners! Your seals!Here we may weep at leisure. Yon fierce ruffianWill scarce pursue us here. Elizabeth,I thought I had done with anger, but the soldierWho gazed on thee awhile, with looks that seemedTo wither thy young beauty, and with words—My child! my child! And I had not the powerTo shield mine own sweet child!I saw him not;I heard him not: I could see none but thee;Could hear no voice but thine.When I am goneWho shall protect thee?I shall soon be tall;And then—Poor boy! Elizabeth, be thou A mother to him. Rear him up in peaceAnd humbleness. Show him how sweet ContentCan smile on dungeon floors; how the mewed larkSings in his narrow cage. Plant patience, dearones,Deep in your hearts.
                     Herbert, where stays the Queen?Still on that hopeless quest of hope, though friendsDrop from her fast as leaves in Autumn?Sire,Her Grace is absent still. But General Cromwell
                  Craves audience of your Majesty.Admit him.Wipe off those tears,Elizabeth. ResumeThy gentle courage. Thou art a Princess.Sir,Thou seest me with my children. Doth thine errandDemand their absence?No. I sent them to theeIn Christian charity. Thou hast not fallenAmongst the Heathen.Howsoever sent,It was a royal boon. My heart hath achedWith the vain agony of longing loveTo look upon those blooming cheeks, to kissThose red and innocent lips, to hear the soundOf those dear voices.Sir, 'twas meet they cameThat thou might'st see them once again, might'st say—Farewell!—I can endure the word—a lastFarewell! I have dwelt so long upon the thought,The sound seems nothing. Ye have signed
                        the sentence?Fear not to speak Sir.'Tis a grievous duty—Ye havesigned. And the day?Tomorrow.What!So soon? And yet I thank  
                        ye. Speed is mercy. Ye must away, poor children.Nay, the childrenMay bide with thee till nightfall.Take them ,Herbert!
                  Take them.Oh! no, no, no!Dear-ones, I go On a great journey. Bless ye once again,My children! We must part. Farewell.Oh father,Let me go with thee!Know'st thou whither?Yes;To Heaven. Oh take me with thee! I must die;When the tree falls, the young buds wither. Take meAlong with thee to Heaven! Let us lieBoth in one grave!Now bless ye! This is death;This is the bitterness of love.Fair childBe comforted.Did'st thou not pat her head?She minded me, all in her innocent tears,Of one in mine own dwelling.Thou hast daughters;Be kind to her.I will.And the poor boy—He comes not near the throne. Make not of him A puppet King.I think not of it.Take them,Good Herbert! And
                     my wife—She shall be safe; shall home to France unharmed.Now fare ye well!—
                     Cromwell come back!—No, bring them not again—No more of parting—bbless them! bless them! See The girl, the poor poor girl, hath wept away Her tears, and pants and shivers like a fawnDying. Oh! for some gentle face to look onWhen she revives, or she will surely die.She shall be cared for.Are they gone? quite gone?I might have kissed them once again, have charged themTo love each other.—No, 'tis best.Thou bad'st meRemain. What is thy will?Be kind to them,Be very kind to them!Have I not promised?Was that what thou would'st say?No. But the love, The o'ermastering love—that was the death-pang. Cromwell,Thou wilt be kind to them?Would'st have me swear?Nay, swear not, lest I doubt. I will believe thee.And for the human pity thou hast shown,The touch of natural ruth, I pray thee take My thanks.I would have saved thee. By this hand,This sinful hand, I would have saved thee, King,Had'st thou flung by yon bauble.There is OneWho reads all hearts, one who pursues all crimes,From silver-tongued and bland hypocrisy To treasonous murder. The unspoken thought,And the loud lie, and the accursed act,Mount to His throne together. Tempt Him not.I know thee for the worker of this deed,And knowing pardon thee:—but tempt not Him!Thy blood be on thy head! I would have saved thee—Even now the thought stirred in me. Pardon, Lord,That gazing on the father's agonies,My heart of flesh waxed faint, and I forgotThy glory andThy cause, the suffering saints.The tyrant's tyranny, and Thy great word,Freedom! Thy blood be on thy head.So be it.
                     Herbert! Is't time
                     to rise? He sleeps. What soundsWere those that roused me? Hark again! The clangOf hammers! Yet the watch-light burns; the dayIs still unborn. This is a work of night,Of deep funereal darkness. Each loud strokeRings like a knell, distinct, discordant, shrill,Gathering, redoubling, echoing round my head,Smiting me only with its sound amidThe slumbering city, tolling in mine ear—A passing bell! It is the scaffold. HeavenGrant me to tread it with as calm a heartAs I bear now. His sleep is troubled.Herbert!
                  'Twere best to wake him. Herbert! rouse thee, man!Did your Grace call?Aye; we should be todayEarly astir. I've a great business toward,To exchange the kingly wreath, my crown of thorns,For an eternal diadem; to die— And I would go trim as a bridegroom. Give meYon ermined cloak. If the crisp nipping frostShould cause me shiver, there be tongues would callThe wintery chillness Fear. Herbert, my sleepHath been as soft and balmy, as young babesInherit from their blessed innocence,Or hardy peasants win with honest toil.When I awoke thy slumbers were perturbed,Unquiet.Vexed, my liege, with dreams.Of what?So please you, Sire, demand not.Dost thou thinkA dream can vex me now? Speak.Thrice I slept,And thrice I woke,and thrice the self-same visionHaunted my fancy. Seemed this very room,This dim and waning taper, this dark couch,Beneath whose crimson canopy reclinedA form august and stately. The pale rayOf the watch-light dwelt upon his face, and showedHis paler lineaments, where majesty And manly beauty,and deep trenching thought,And Care the wrinkler, all were blended nowInto one calm and holy pensiveness,Softened by slumber. I stood gazing on himWith weeping love, as one awake; when suddenA thick and palpable darkness fell around,A blindness, and dull groans and piercing shrieksA moment echoed; then they ceased, and light Burst forth and musick—light such as the floodOf day-spring at the dawning, rosy, sparkling,An insupportable brightness—and i'th' midst,Over the couch, a milk-white dove, which soared Right upward, cleaving with its train of lightThe Heavens like a star. The couch remainedVacant.Oh that the spirit so may pass!So rise! Thrice did'st thou say?Three times the visionPassed o'er my fancy.A thrice-blessed omen! 
                     Herbert, my soul is full of serious joy,Content and peaceful as the Autumn sun,When, smiling for awhile on the ripe sheavesAnd kissing the brown woods, he bids the worldA calm goodnight. Bear witness that I dieIn charity with all men; and take thou, My kind and faithful servant, followerOf my evil fortunes, true and tender, take All that thy master hath to give—his thanks,His poor but honest thanks. Another KingShall better pay thee. Weep not. Seek the
                        Bishop;And if thou meet with that fair constancy, My mournful Henrietta, strive to turnHer steps away till—I'm a coward yet,And fear her, lest she come to plunge my thoughtsIn the deep fountain of her sad fond tears,To win me—Ha! can that impatient foot,That hurrying hand, which shakes the door—My Charles!Haste to the Bishop.Charles!Already here!Thou did'st fall trembling in my arms, last night,Dizzy and faint and spent, as the tired martlet,Midway her voyage, drops panting on the deck,And slumbers through the tempest. I kissed offThe tears that hung on those fair eyelids, blessingThy speechless weariness, thy weeping loveThat sobbed itself to rest. Never did motherWatching her fevered infant pray for sleep So calm, so deep, so long, as I besought Of Heaven for thee when half unconscious, yetMoaning and plaining like a dove, they bore theeWith gentle force away. And thou art hereAlready! wakened into sense and life And the day's agony.Here! I have beenTo Harrison, to
                        Marten, to Lord
                        Fairfax, To Downes, to Ireton,— even at Bradshaw's feetI've knelt to day. Sleep now? shall I e'er sleep Again!At Bradshaw's feet! Oh perfect loveHow can I chide thee? Yet I would thou had'st sparedThyself and me that scorn.Do Hunters scornThe shrill cries of the lioness, whose cubsThey've snared, although the Forest-Queen approachCrouching? Do seamen scorn the forked lightningAlbeit the storm-cloud weep? They strove to soothe; They spake of pity; one of hope.Alas!All thy life long the torturer hope hath beenThy master!—Yet if she can steal an hourFrom grief—whom dost thou trust?Thyself and Heaven And a relenting woman. Wrap thyselfClose in my cloak—Here! here!—to Lady Fairfax!She's faithful; she'll conceal thee. Take the cloak;Waste not a point of time, not whilst the grain of sand Runs in the glass. Dost fear its shortness? SeeHow long it is! On with the cloak. Begone!And thou?My post is here.To perishNo,To live to a blest old age with thee in freedom.Away my Charles, my
                     King! I shall be safe—And if I were not could I live if thou—Charles, thou wilt madden me. 'Tis the first boonI ever craved;and now, by our young loves,By our commingled griefs, a mighty spell,Our smiling children and this bleeding land,Go! I conjure thee, go!I cannot.
                     King
                  Begone! or I will speak such truth—and truth Is a foul treason in this land—will rainSuch curses on them, as shall force them to send meTo the scaffold at thy side. Fly!Dost thou see Fierce soldiers crowded round, as if to watch A garrisoned fort, rather than one unarmedDefenceless man, and think'st thou I could win A step unchallenged? Nor though to escape Were easy as to breathe, the vigilant guardSmitten with sudden blindness, the unnumberedAnd stirring swarms of this vast city lockedIn charmed sleep, and darkness over allBlacker than starless night, spectral and dimAs an eclipse at noontide, though the gatesOpened before me,and my feet were swiftAs the Antelope's, not then if it but perilledA single hair of friend or foe would IPass o'er the threshold. In my cause too muchOf blood hath fallen. Let mine seal all. I goTo death as to a bridal; thou thyselfIn thy young beauty was not welcomerThan he. Farewell, beloved wife! My chosen!My dear- one! We have loved as peasantsBeen fond and true as theyNow fare thee well!I thank thee,and I bless thee. Pray for me,My Henrietta.
                     Charles, thou shalt be saved. Talk not of parting. I'll to Fairfax; he Gave hope, and hope is life.Farewell!That word—I prythee speak it not—withers me, lives Like a serpent's hiss within mine ear, shouts throughMy veins like poison, twines and coils about meClinging and killing. 'Tis a sound accurst,A word of death and doom. Why shouldst thou speak it?Thou shalt be saved; Fairfax shall save thee. Charles,Give me a ringlet of thy hair—No, no—Not now! Not now!Thou shalt not die.Sweet wife,Say to my children that my last fond thought—Last! Thou shalt live to tell them of thy thoughtsLonger than they or I to hear thee. HarkenPromise thou wilt await me here! Let none— They will not dare, they shall not. I but wasteThe hour. To Fairfax,
                     the good Fairfax! Charles
                  Thou shalt not dieOh truest fondest woman! My matchless wife! The pang is mastered now,I am Death's conqueror. My Faithfullest! My Fairest! My mostdear! I ne'er shall see Those radiant looks again, or hear the soundOf thy b voice, which was a hope, or feelThe thrilling pressure of thy hand, almostA language, so the ardent spirit burnedAnd vibrated within thee! I'll to prayer,And chase away that image! I'll to prayer,And pray for thee, sweet wife! I'll to my prayers.
                     Cromwell!—Good-morrow Ireton!Whither goesThe General?To see that all be readyFor this great deed.He hath the eager step,The dark light in his eye, the upward look,The flush upon his cheek, that I've marked in himWhen marching to the battle.Doth he not leadTo day in a great combat, a most holyAnd glorious victory?Hast thou ta'en orderThat soon as the head's off the 
                        Abbey bellBegin to toll?I have.Look that the axeBe keen,and the hand steady. Let us haveNo butchery.If he die not, we must perish—That were as nothing! but with us will dieThe liberty for which the blood of saintsAnd martyrs hath been spilt, freedom of act,Of speech, of will, of faith! Better one grey Discrowned head should fall, albeit a thoughtBefore the time, than God's own people groanIn slavery forever.Whoso doubtethBut he shall die?'Tis rumoured, Sirs, amongst ,The soldiery, that one of a high place,
                     Fairfax—But I believe
                     it not. Hast thouThe Warrant Hacker?
                  No.Since when doth Fairfax
                  Dare to impugn the sentence of a free And publick court, of England—Of the GreatAll-Righteous Judge who hath delivered himManifestly to us?Will he dare oppose 
                     Armyand people? He alone!Be sureThe good Lord-General, howsoe'er some scrupleMay trouble him, will play a godly partIn this sad drama.—Aye, I have the Warrant!It is addressed to thee. Thou must receiveThe prisoner,and conduct him hither.HathThe hour been yet resolved?Not that I hear.Ha! our great General! Well met my Lord!We that are laden with this heavy burthenLacked your sustaining aid!
                     Cromwell, I tooAm heavy-laden.You look ill at ease;'Tis this chill air, the nourisher of rheums,The very fog of frost, that turns men's bloodTo water.No, the grief is here. Regret,Almost remorse, and doubt and fear of wrongPress heavily upon me. Is this deathLawful?His country's sentence, good my Lord, May be thy warrant.An anointed King!A bloody tyrant.Yet a man, whose doom Lies on our conscience. We might save the King
                  Even now at the eleventh hour; we two Hold the nice scales of life and death, and shall notFair mercy sway the balance? Dost thou hear me?Wilt thou not answer? Canst thou doubt our power?No. Man hath always power for ill. I knowWe might desert our friends, betray our country,Abandon our great cause, and sell our soulsTo Hell. We might do this,and more; might shroudThese devilish sins in holy names, and call themLoyalty, Honour, Faith, Repentance—cheatsWhich the great Tempter loves!Yet harken,Cromwell!Bethink thee of thy fameTalk'st thou of fameTo me? I am too mean a man, too lowly,Too poor in state and name to need abjureThat princely sin, and for my humblenessI duly render thanks. Were I as thou—Beware the lust of fame, Lord
                        General,Of perishable fame, vain breath of man,Slight bubble, frailer than the ocean foamWhich from her prow the good ship in her courseScattereth and passeth on regardlessly.Lord General beware!I am Lord General;And I alone by mine own voice have powerTo stay this deed.Alone?I'll answer itBefore the Council.Ha! alone!—come nearer.What would'st thou of me?Yonder men are firmAnd honest in the cause, and brave as steel;Yet are they zealots, blind and furious zealots! I would not they should hear us—bloody zealots!Speak, Sir; we waste the hour.I would confessRelentings like thine own.—They hear us not?I joy to hear thee.Thou art one elect,A leader in the land, a chosen vessel,And yet of such a mild and gracious mood,That I, stern as I seem, may doff to theeThis smooth and governed mask of polity, And shew the struggling heart perplexed and grievedIn all its nakedness. Yes, I have knownThe kindly natural love of man to manHis fellow!—the rough soldier's shuddering hateOf violent death, save in the battle; lastly A passionate yearning for that sweetest powerBorn of fair Mercy.Yet but now thou chidd'st meAnd with a lofty scorn for such 
                        
                     a weakness.The change is sudden.Good my lord, I strove And wrestled with each pitying thought as bornOf earthly pride and mortal sin. Full oftWe, that are watchers of our wretched selves,Aiming at p
                     higher virtues, trample downFair shoots of charity and gentle loveYet still my breast was troubled. and since thouArt moved by such relentings—And a promise Made to my wifeA wise and pious lady!Thou wilt then save the King?Sir,  we must have Some higher warrantry than our wild will,Our treacherous human will, afore we changeThe fiat of a nation. Thou art a manElect and godly—Harrison!—go seek The presence of the Lord. Perhaps to theeA guiding answer, a divine impulsion,May be vouchsafed. Go with him Harrison! Seek ye the Lord together.'Tis a wiseAnd pious counsel.Step apart awhile;We will await ye here.Now! now! be quick! Is the scaffold all prepared? The headsman waitingWith shrouded visage and bare arm? The axe Whetted? Be ready on the instant. WhereBe guards to line the room, mute wondering faces,A living tapestry, and men of place To witness this great deed? A King should fallDecked with the pageantries of Death, the cloudsThat roll around the setting sun.If Fairfax
                  Return before he come—Dost thou mistrust
                     Harrison's gift in
                     prayer? The General's safe. Besides I sent erewhile the HalberdiersTo guard Charles
                        Stuart hither. Hacker'll
                     meetHis prisoner.But should Fairfax—Wherefore wasteA word on such a waverer!What hath swayed him?His wife! his wife! The Queen hath seen againThat haughty dame, and her fond tears—I marvelThat thou endur'st that popish witch of
                        France
                  So near.I watch her. He must die! 'Tis borneUpon my soul as what shall be. The race,The name shall perish.Aye, the very nameOf King.Of Stuart.
                  And of King.So be it.Will Bradshaw never come?Ah welcome! welcome!Ye are late.Yon living mass is hard to pierceBy men of civil calling. The armed soldiersCan scantly force a passage for their prisoner.He comes?He's at the gate.What say the people?The most are pale and silent, as a FearHung its dull shadow over them; whilst someStruck with a sudden pity weep and wonder What ails them; and a few bold tongues are loudIn execration.And the soldiers?TheyAre true to the good cause.The righteous cause!My friends and comrades ye are come to witnessThe mighty consummation. See, the sunBreaks forth! The Heavens look down upon our workSmiling! The Lord hath risen!The King!Why pause ye?Come on.Sire, from thy Son.My boy! My boy!No; no; this letter is of life, and I And life have shaken hands. My kingly boy!And the fair girl! I thought to have done with this.But it so clings! Take back the letter,Herbert.Take it, I say. Forgive me, faithful Herbert,That last impatient word. Forgive me. Now, Sirs,What see ye on that platform? I am as oneBent on a far and perilous voyage, who seeksTo hear what rocks beset his path. What see ye?Only the black-masked headsman.Aye, he wears His mask upon his face, an honest mask.What see ye more?Nought save the living seaOf human faces, blent into one massOf sentient various life: woman and man, Childhood and infancy,and youth and age,Commingled with its multitudinous eyesUpturned in expectation. Aweful gaze!Who may abide thy power?I shall look upward.Why pause we here?Aye, why?May it please thee, Sir,To rest awhile? Bring wine.I need it not. Yes! fill the cup! fill high the sparkling cup!This is a holiday to loyal breasts,The King's accession day. Fill high! fill high!The block, the scaffold, the  swift sudden axe,Have yet a privilege beyond the slowAnd painful dying bed, and I may quaff In my full pride of strength a health to him,Whom, pass one short half-hour, the funeral knellProclaims my successor.  Health to my son!Health to the King of England! Start ye, Sirs,To hear the word? Health to King Charles,and peace,To this fair realm! And when that blessed timeOf rightful rule shall come, say that I leftFor the bold traitors that condemned, the cowardsWhonot opposing murdered me(I have wonSo near the Throne of Truth that
                     true words springUnbidden from my lips,) say that I leftA pardon, liberal as the air, to all,A free and
                        
                      royal pardon!—Prythee speed meOn my rough journey.Wherefore crowd ye there?Make way.I thank thee, Sir. My good Lord Bishop,Beware the step.—Doth he address the people?Not so. He kneels.'Twere fittest. Close the door.This wintery air is chill, and the Lord PresidentIs of a feeble body.Hush! 'Tis oneWho must be stayed.The Queen? Go stop her,Ireton.It were not meet that earthly loves should mingleWith yonder dying prayer. Yes! Still he kneels.
                     Hacker come hither. If thou see a stirAmongst the crowd, send for my horse; they're ready;—Or if, midst  grave men, some feeble heart Wax faint in the great cause, as such there be;—Or on the scaffold, if he cling to lifeToo fondly;—I'd not send a sinful soulBefore his time to his accompt, good Bradshaw!But no delay!Is he still kneeling?—Mark meNo idle dalliance Hacker! I must hence,Lest Fairfax—no weak dalliance! no delay!The cause, the cause, good Bradshaw!Methought I heard her here.—No!—if she win To Fairfax!—he must die, as Ahab erstOr Rehoboam, or as that great heathenWhom Brutus loved and slew. None ever called
                  Brutus a murderer! And
                     Charles had trial—'Twas more than Caesar had!—free open trial,If he had pleaded. But the Eternal WrathStiffened him in his pride. It was ordained,And I but an impassive instrument In the Almighty hand, an arrow chosenFrom out the sheaf. If I should reign hereafter Men shall not call me bloody.—Hark! the bell!No—all is hush as midnight.—I shall be Tenderer of English lives. Have they forgotTo sound the bell? He must be dead.
                  Lord Fairfax!The Queen! the Queen!They told me he was here— I see him not,—but I have wept me blind;—And then that axe, that keen, bright, edgy axe,Which flashed across my eyeballs, blinding meMore than a sea of tears.—Here's one!: — Oh flyIf thou be man, and bid the headsman stayHis blow for one short hour, one little hour,Till I have found Lord Fairfax! Thou shalt
                  have Gold, mines of gold! Oh save him! Save the King!Peace! peace! Have comfort!Comfort! and he dies,They murder him; the axe falls on his neck;The blood comes plashing;—Comfort!Out alas!I can hear nought of Fairfax, royal Madam!—
                  Cromwell, the Master-murderer!Oh forgive her!She knows not what she says. If thou be Cromwell
               Thou hast the power to rescue: See I kneel;I kiss thy feet. Oh save him! Take the crown;Take all but his dear life! Oh save him, save him!And I will be thy slave!—I, a born Princess,I, a crowned Queen, will be thy slave.Arise!My Lady Fairfax lead this frantic
                  womanTo where her children bide.Thou wilt not makeMy children fatherless? Oh mercy! Mercy!I have a girl, a weeping innocent girl,That never learnt to smile, and she shall beThy handmaid; she shall tend thy daughters. I,That was so proud, offer my fairest child To be thy bondwoman.Raise her! UndoThese clasping hands. I marvel,Lady
                  Fairfax,Thou canst endure to see a creature kneelTo one create.Out on thee,hypocrite!Where lags my husband?Save him, save him,Cromwell!
               Woman arise! Will this long agonyEndure forever?Is he dead?What meansThis piercing outcry?
                  Fairfax! He is saved!He is saved!The bell! the Abbey bell! Hark!ThereThe will of Heaven spake. The King is dead.Look to the Queen. Cromwell, this bloody
                  workIs thine.This work is mine. For yon sad dame,She shall away to France. This
                  deed is mine,And I will answer it. The CommonwealthIs firmly 'stablished Ireton. Harrison,The Saints shall rule in Israel. My Lord General,The army is thine own, and I a soldier,A lowly follower in the cause.
                  This deed
               Is mine.—
