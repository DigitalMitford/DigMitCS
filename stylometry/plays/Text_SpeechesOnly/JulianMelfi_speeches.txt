No; still he
							sleeps! ’Twas but the myrtle
							budTapping against the casement, as the windStirred in the leafy branches. Well he lovedThat pleasant bird-like sound, which, as a voiceSummon’d us forth into the fresher
							airOf eve, or early morn. Ah! when
							again—And yet his sleep is hopeful. For seven nightsHe had not tasted slumber. Who comes here?The gentle page! Alas! To wake him now!Hush, Theodore! Tread softly—softlier, boy!Doth he still sleep?Speak lower.Doth he sleep?Avoid the couch; come this way; close to me.He sleeps. He hath not moved in all the hoursThat thou hast been away.Then we may hope,Dear lady, we may hope!Alas! Alas!See how he lies, scarce breathing. Whilst I hungOver his couch I should have thought him
							dead,but for his short and frequent sighs.Ah me!Not even in slumber can he lose the senseOf that deep misery; and I—he wakes!Dost thou not see the quivering mantle heaveWith sudden motion?Thou hast wakened him.Thy clamorous grief hath roused him. Hence! Begone!Leave me!And yet his eyes are closed. He sleeps.He did but move his hand.How changed he is!How pale! How wasted! Can one little
							weekOf pain and sickness so have faded thee,My princely Julian! But eight days agoThere lived not in this gladsome SicilySo glad a spirit. Voice, and step, and eye,All were one happiness; till that dread
							hour,When drest in sparkling smiles, radiant and
							glowing,With tender thoughts, he flew to meet the KingAnd his great father. He went forth
							alone;Frenzy and grief came back with him.And I, Another grief.Thou wast a comforter.All stranger as thou art, hast thou not sharedMy watch as carefully, as faithfully,As I had been thy
							sister? Aye, and heIf ever in this wild mysterious woeOne sight or sound hath cheered him, it hath beenA glance, a word of thine.He knows me not.He knows not me.I never heard beforeThat ’twas to meet the King yon fatal
					          		night—Knowingly, purposely— How could he guessThat they should meet? What moved him to that thought?Stranger, although thou be, thou canst but knowPrince Julian’s father is the regent here,And rules for his young kinsman King Alfonso!Aye—Poor Alfonso!Wherefore pity him?I know not—but I am an orphan
							too!I interrupt thee, lady.Yet, in truth,A gentle pity lingers round the nameOf King Alfonso orphaned, as thou
							sayst,And drooping into sickness when he
							lostHis father, ever since, the mournful
							boyHath dwelt in the Villa d’Oro.Hast thou seen him?The King? No— I’m of Naples. When Prince JulianFirst brought me here a bride, his royal
							cousinWas fixed beside his father’s dying bed.I never saw him: yet I know him
							well;For I have sate and listen’d, hour by hour,To hear my husband speak of the fair
							Prince,And his excelling virtues.Did he?—Ah!--But ’twas his wont, talking of those he loved,To gild them with the rich, and burnish’d glowOf his own brightness, as the evening sunDecks all the clouds in glory.Very dearWas that young boy to Julian. ’Twas a
							friendship,Fonder than common, blended with a kindProtecting tenderness; such as brotherMight fitly shew unto the younger born.Oh, he hath proved it.Thou dost know them both?I do. Say on, dear lady.Three weeks
							sinceThe Duke of Melfi went to bring his wardHere to Messina—To be crowned. They came not.But wherefore went Prince Julian forth to meet them?Father nor cousin came; nor messenger,From Regent or from King; and Julian
							chafedAnd fretted at delay. At length, a
							peasant,No liveried groom; a slow foot-pacing serf,Brought tidings that the royal two, that
							mornLeft Villa d’Oro. Glowing from the chasePrince Julian stood, the bridle in his hand,New lighted, soothing now his prancing steed.And prattling now to me;— for I was stillSo foolish fond to fly into the porchTo meet him, when I heard the quick sharp
									treadOf that bright Arab, whose proud step I knewEven as his master’s voice. He heard the taleAnd instant sprang again into his seat,Wheeled round, and darted off at such a paceAs the fleet greyhound, at her speed, could
									scarceHave matched. He spake no word; but as he
									passed,Just glanced back at me, with his dancing eyes,And such a smile of joy, and such a waveOf his plumed bonnet! His return thou
							know’st.I was his wretched partner.He on foot,Thou on the o’er-travelled horse, slow, yet all
							stainedWith sweat, and panting, as if fresh escapedFrom hot pursuit; and how he called for wineFor his poor Theodore, his faithful
							page;Then sate him down and shook with the cold fitOf anguish fever, till the strong couch rockedLike a child’s cradle. There he sate and sigh’d;And then the frenzy came. Theodore!Lady!He utters nought but madness;—yet sometimes,Athwart his ravings, I have thought—have
							feared—Theodore, thou must know the
							cause?Too well.Oh, tell me—Hush! He
							wakes.Julian! Dear Julian!Sure I have slept a long, long while! Where am I?How came I hither? Whose kind hand is this?My Annabel!Oh, what a happiness To see thee gently wake from gentle sleep!Art thou not better? Shall I raise thee up?Aye, dearest. Have I then been ill? I’m
							weak,I trouble thee, my sweet one.’Tis a joyTo minister unto thee.Wipe my brow.And part these locks, that the fresh air may coolMy forehead; feel; it
							burns.Alas! how wildThis long neglect hath made thy glossy
							curls,How tangled!I am faint. Pray, lay me down.Surely the day is stiflingThere.Good boy.Throw wide the casement. Doth not the soft breezeRevive thee?Yes. I’m better. I will rise.Raise me again;—more upright;— So! Dear
									wife,A sick man is as wayward as a child;Have I been long ill?A week.I have no memory of aught. ’Tis justLike waking from a dream; a
							horribleConfusion of strange miseries; crime and
							bloodAnd all I love.— Great Heaven, how clear it
							seems!How like a truth! I thought that I rode forthOn my white Barbary horse—Say, did I
							rideAlone that day?Yes.Did I? Could I? No.Thou dost mistake. I did not. Yet ’tis
							strangeHow plain that horror lives within my
							brainAs what hath been.Forget it.Annabel,I thought I was upon that gallant steedAt his full pace. Like clouds before the windWe flew, as easily as the strong birdThat soars nearest the sun; till in a
							pass,Between the mountains, screams and cries of
							helpRang in mine ears, and I beheld—O
							God!It was not—Could not—No. I have been sickOf a sharp fever, and delirium shews,And to the bodily sense makes palpable,Unreal forms, objects of sight and
							soundWhich have no being save in the burning
							brainOf the poor sufferer. Why should it shake me!Couldst thou walk to the window and
							quaff downThe fragrant breeze, it would revive thee moreThan food or sleep. Forget these evil dreams.Canst thou not walk?I’ll try.Lean upon me,And Theodore. Approach dear boy; support him.Ha! Art thou here? Thou! I am blinded, dazzled!Is this a vision, this fair shape that seemsA living child? Do I dream now?He isYoung Theodore. The page, who that sad nightReturned—Then all is real. Lay me downThat I may dieAlas! I feared too surelyThat when he saw me,—Julian! This is grief,Not sickness. Julian!Rouse him not, dear
							lady!See how his hands are clenched. Waken him
							notTo frenzy. Oh that I alone could bearThis weight of misery.He knows the cause, And I— It is my right, my privilegeTo share thy woes, to soothe them. I’ll weep with thee,And that will be a comfort. Didst thou thinkThou could’st be dearer to me than
						            	beforeWhen thou wast well and happy? But thou artNow. Tell me this secret.  I’ll be faithful,I’ll never breathe a word. Oh spare my
							heartThis agony of doubt! What was the horrorThat maddened thee?Within the rifted rocksOf high Albano, rotting in a glen,Dark, dark at very noon, a father liesMurdered by his own son.And thou didst seeThe deed! An awful sight to one so good!Yet—Birds obscene, and wolf, and ravening fox,Ere this— only the dark hairs on the ground.And the brown crusted blood! And she can askWhy I am mad!Oh! a thrice awful nightTo one so duteous! Holy priests should laveWith blessed water that foul spot, and thou,Pious and pitying, thou shalt—Hear at once,Innocent Torturer, that drop by dropPour’st molten lead into my wounds—that glen—Hang not upon me!—In that darksome glenMy father lies. I am a murderer,A parricide, accurst of God and man.Let go my hand! purest and whitest saint,Let go!This is a madness. Even nowThe fever shakes him.Why, the mad are happy!Annabel, this is a soul-slaying truth.There stands a witness.Julian knew him not.It was to save a life, a worthless
							life.Oh that I had but died beneath the swordThat seemed so terrible! That I had ne’erBeen born to grieve thee Julian! Pardon me,Dear lady, pardon me!Oh, gentle boy,How shall we soothe this grief?Alas! alas!Why did he rescue me! I’m a poor orphan;None would have wept for me; I had no
							friendIn all the worldsave one. I had been reared.In simpleness; a quiet grave had beenA fitter home for me than the rude world;A mossy heap, no stone, no epitaph,Save the brief words of grief and praise (for GriefIs still a Praiser) he perchance had spokeWhen they first told him the poor boy was dead.Shame on me, that I shunned the sword!By Heaven,It could not be a crime to save thee! kneelBefore him, Annabel. He is the kingAlfonso?Aye, so please you, fairest Cousin,But still your servant. Do not hate me,
							Lady,Though I have caused this misery. We have sharedOne care, one fear, one hope, have watched and weptTogether. Oh how often I have longed,As we sate silent by his restless couch,To fall upon thy neck and mix our tears,And talk of him. I am his own poor Cousin.Thou wilt not hate me?Save that lost one, whoCould hate such innocence?’Twas not in hate,But wild ambition. No ignoble sinDwelt in his breast. Ambition, mad ambition,That was his Idol. To that bloody godHe offered up the milk-white
							sacrifice,The pure, unspotted Victim. And even then,Even in the crime, without a breathing spaceFor penitence, or prayer, my sword—Alfonso,Thou would’st have gone to Heaven.Art thou certainThat he is dead?I saw him fall. The groundWas covered with his blood.Tell me the tale.Didst thou— I would not wantonly recallThat scene of anguish—Didst thou search his wound?Annabel, in my eyes that scene will dwellFor ever, shutting out all lovely sights,Even thee, my Beautiful! That torturing thoughtWill burn a living fire within my
						            	breastPerpetually; words can nothing add,And nothing take away. Fear not my frenzy;I am calm now. Thou know’st how buoyantlyI darted from thee, straight o’er vale and hill,Counting the miles by minutes. At the passBetween the Albano mountains, I first breathedA moment my hot steed, expecting stillTo see the royal escort. Afar offAs I stood, shading with my hand my eyes,I thought I saw them; when at once I heardFrom the deep glen, east of the pass, loud criesOf mortal terror. Even in agonyI knew the voice, and darting through the trees.I saw Alfonso, prostrate on the ground,Clinging around the knees of one, who heldA dagger over him in act to strike,Yet with averted head, as if he fearedTo see his innocent victim. His own faceWas hidden; till at one spring I plunged my swordInto his side; then our eyes met, and he—
                     That was the mortal blow!
									—screamed and stretched outHis hands. Falling and dying as he was,He half rose up, hung speechless in the air,And looked—Oh what had been the bitterest
									curseTo such a look! It smote me like a sword!Here, here. He died.And thou?I could have lainIn that dark glen for ever; but there stoodThe dear-bought, and the dear, kinsman and princeAnd friend. We heard the far-off clang of steedsAnd armed men, and fearing some new foe,Came homeward.And did he, then, the unhappy,Remain upon the ground?Alas! he did. Oh! it was but a swoon. Listen, dear Julian,I tell thee I have comfort.There is noneLeft in the world. But I will listen to theeMy Faithfullest.Count D’Alba sent to craveAn audience. Thou wast sleeping. I refusedTo see him; but his messenger revealedTo Constance his high tidings, which she pouredIn my unwilling ears, for I so fearedTo wake thee, that ere half her tale was toldI chid her from me; yet she surely saidThe Duke thy father—What?Approached the city.Alive? Alive? Oh no! no! no! Dead! Dead!The corse, the clay-cold corse!Alive, I think;But Constance—He will sink under this shockOf hope.Constance heard all.Constance! What ho,Constance!She hears thee not.Go seek her! Fly!If he’s alive—Why art thou not returned,When that one little word will save two souls!Take patience, dearest Cousin!Do I not standHere like a man of marble? Do I stir?She creeps; she creeps. Thou would’st have gone and backIn half the time.Nay, nay, ’tis scarce a minute.Thou may’st count hours and ages on my heart.Is she not coming?Shall I seek her?Hark!They’ve met. There are two steps; two silken gownsRustling; one whispering voice. Annabel!
							Constance.Is he—one word!Only one word!He lives.Again refuse to see me!Nay, my lord,She’s still beside her husband’s couch, and PaoloRefused to bear the message.Even her lacqueyReads my hot love and her contempt. No matter!How’s Julian?Mending fast.He’ll live! He’ll live!She watches over him, making an airWith her sweet breath;—he’ll be immortal! YetIf that dark tale be true—or half—Bertone,Haste to the Court of Guard; seek Juan Castro,A Spanish soldier; lead him home. I’ll join ye.Hence! I expect the Barons, whom I summonedTo meet me here. Come back. See if the PrincessWill now admit me. No! ’twould wake suspicion.Hence to the Court of GuardI think that scornDoth fan love more than beauty. Twice to-dayHave I paced patiently these royal halls,Like some expecting needy courtier. Swell not,Proud charmer, thy vast debt! Where lag these Barons?Methinks this change might rouse—Ha! Calvi, welcome.A fair good morrow, D’Alba!Hast thou heardThese heavy tidings? The young kingKing—My Lords,Good morrow’s out of date. Know ye the
							news?So men salute to-day.Alfonso dead?Murdered.And Melfi King.Aye, here’s a letter.giving
								                		a letter to Calvi.
                  From the great Regent—Pshaw! how my rude
                     		tongueStumbles at these new dignities!--the King.Therefore I summoned ye. He will be hereAnon.Valore, thou art late.This talePuts lead into men’s heels. How fell it?Read!Count Calvi! Read!He hath been wounded!He’s alive. The boy!Only the pretty boy! Read on. Read on.The King. How he will wear his state! Why, D’Alba,Thy worshipped Annabel chose well; she’ll beA Queen.Yet, my poor title, had she graced it,Comes by unquestion’d sheer descent, unstain’dBy dark, mysterious murder. My good fathers—Heaven rest their souls!—lie safely in the churchyard,A simple race; whilst these high Princes—Sirs,These palace walls have echoes, or I’d tell ye—’Tis a deep riddle, but amongst them allThe pretty boy is dead. Leanti! Lords,The King is at the gate.The King! Now, Sirs,Don your quick smiles, and bend your supple
							knees;—The King!He’s pale, he hath been hurt.aloud My liege,Your vassals bid you welcome.Noble Signors,I greet you well. Thanks, D’Alba. Good LeantiI joy to see those reverend locks. I neverThought to behold a friendly face again.And now I bring ye sorrow. Death hath beenToo busy; though the ripe and bearded earEscap’d his sickle—but ye know the tale;Ye welcomed me as King; and I am sparedThe painful repetition. Sire, we knowFrom your own royal hand enough for joyAnd sorrow. Death hath ta’en a goodly childAnd spared a glorious man. But how—My lord,What wouldst thou more? Before I entered hereMessina’s general voice had hailed her Sovereign.Lacks but the ceremonial form. ’Twere bestThe accustomed pageant were performed even
							now,Whilst ye, Sicilian Barons, strength and graceOf our Sicilian realm, are here to pledgeSolemn allegiance. Say I sooth, Count D’Alba?In sooth my liege, I know not. Seems to meOne form is wanting. Our bereaved stateStands like a widow, one eye dropping tearsFor her lost lord, the other turned with smilesOn her new bridegroom. But even she, the DameOf Ephesus, the buxom relict, famedFor quick dispatch o’er every widowed mate,Woman or state—even she, before she wed,Saw the good man entombed. The Funeral first;And then the Coronation.Scoffer! Lords,The corse is missing.Ha! Perchance he lives?He fell, I tell thee.And the Assassin?HeEscaped, when I too fell.He! Why, my liege,Was there but one?What mean ye, Sirs? Stand off.Cannot your Highness guess the murderer?Stand from about me, Lords! Dare ye to frontA King? What do ye doubt me; you, or you?Dare ye to doubt me? Dare ye look a questionInto mine eyes? Take thy gaze off! A KingDemands a modester regard. Now, Sirs,What do ye seek? I tell ye, the fair boyFell underneath the assassin’s sword; and I,Wounded almost to death, am saved to proveMy subjects’ faith, to punish, to reward,To reign, I tell ye, nobles. Now, who questions?Who glares upon me now? What! are ye mute?Deign to receive our homage, Sire, and pardonThe undesigned offence. Your Highness knowsCount D’Alba’s mood.And he knows mine. Well! Well!Be all these heats forgotten.How his eyeWanders around the circle.Ye are met,Barons of Sicily, in such augustAnd full assemblage as may well beseemYour office, honour well yourselves and me;Yet one is missing,—greatest, first and best,—My son. Knows not Prince Julian that his fatherIs here? Will he not come? Go, some one sayThat I would see him.Sire, the Prince hath lainSick of a desperate malady.Alas!And I—Sick didst thou say?Eight days have passedSince he hath left his couch.He’s better now.The gentle Princess, who with one young pageHath tended him—What page?A stranger boy,Seen but of few, young Theodore.A stranger!Say on. The Princess—?As I crossed the hall,I met her, with her own glad step, her lookOf joy; and when I asked how fared Prince Julian?She put her white hands into mine, with suchA smile, and then passed on.Without a word?Without a word, save the mute eloquenceOf that bright smile.Oh ’twas enough! on him!Smile on that dotard! Whilst I—aloud Why my lords,Here’s a fine natural sympathy; the sonSickens at the father’s wound! The very day!The very hour! He must have known the deed—Perchance he knows the assassin—Stop.My liege,I speak it in his honour. Many an heirHad been right glad to step into a throneJust as the mounting pulse of youth beat high;—A soldier too! and with a bride so fair,So delicate, so fashioned for a QueenBy cunning nature. But he—for full surelyHe knew—Stop. No, no, no, he knew it not!He is my son.My liege, the
							Prince!Already!Pardon me, good my lords, that I requestA moment’s loneliness. We have been nearTo death since last—Have touched upon the grave,And there are thoughts, which only our own heartsShould hear. I pray ye pardon me. I’ll join yeWithin the hour for the procession.Julian!Father!I know what thou would’st say. The hatAnd sable plumes concealed—No more of it.Oh, Father!Rise, my son. Let us forgetWhat—How is Annabel? They say she has beenA faithful nurse. Thou hast been sick?I’m well.Fie! when thou tremblest so.I’m well. I have beenSick, brainsick, heartsick, mad. I thought—I feared—It was a foretaste of the pains of HellTo be so mad and yet retain the senseOf that which made me so. But thou art here,And I—Oh nothing but a father’s heartCould ever have forgiven!No more. No more!Thou hast not told me of thy wife.She waitsTo pay her duty.Stay. Count D’Alba lookedWith evil eyes upon thee, and on meCast his accustomed tauntings. Is there aughtAmiss between ye?No.He hath not yetPerhaps forgotten your long rivalryFor Annabel’s fair hand. A dangerous meaningLurked in those bitter gibes. A dangerous foeWere D’Alba. Julian, the sea breeze to theeBrings health, and strength, and joy. I have an errandAs far as Madrid. None so well as thouCan bid it speed. There shalt away to day;—’Tis thy best medicine;—thou and thy young wife.The wind is fair.To day!Have I not said?Send me just risen from a sick couch to Madrid!Send me from home, from thee! Banish me! Father,Canst thou not bear my sight?I cannot bearContention. Must I needs remind thee, Julian,I have also been ill?I’ll go to day.How pale he is! I had not dared beforeTo look upon his face. I’ll go to day.This very hour?This very hour.My son!Now call thy—yet a moment. Where’s the boy—He shall aboard with thee—thy pretty page?The King? Mean’st thou the King?He, whom thou call’st—Wilt thou not say the King?Young Theodore.Hearken, Prince Julian! I am glad, right gladOf what hath chanced. ’Twas well to bring him hither,And keep him at thy side. He shall awayTo Spain with thee, that Theodore—ForgetAll other titles. He’ll be glad of this.A favourite page, a spoilt and petted boy,To lie in summer gardens, in the shadeOf orange groves, whose pearly blossoms fallAmidst his clustering curls, and to his luteSing tenderest ditties,—such his happy lot;Whilst I—Go, bring thy wife.He is the King.Call lady Annabel.The King, I say,The rightful King, the only King! I’ll shedThe last drop in my veins for King Alfonso.Once I forgave thee. But to beard me thus,And for a weak and peevish youth, a faintling,A boy of a girl’s temper; one who shrinksTrembling and crouching at a look, a word,A lifted finger, like a beaten hound.Alas! poor boy! he hath no other friendSince thou, who should’st defend him,—Father, Father,Three months have scarcely passed since thy dear brother,(Oh, surely thou lovedst him!) with the last wordsHe ever spake, besought thy guardian careOf his fair child. Next upon me he turnedHis dying eyes, quite speechless then, and thou—I could not speak, for poor Alfonso threwHimself upon my breast, with such a
							gushOf natural grief, I had no utterance—But thou didst vow for both protection, faith,Allegiance; thou didst swear so fervently,So deeply, that the spirit flew to HeavenSmiling. I’ll keep that oath.Even if again thy sword—Urge not that thought on me. ’Tis a fireHere in my heart, my brain. Bethink thee, Father,Soldier or statesman, thine is the first nameOf Sicily, the General, Regent, Prince,The unmatch’d in power, the unapproach’d in fame;What could that little word a King do moreFor thee?That little word! Why that is fame,And power and glory! That shall fill the world,Lend a whole age its name, and float alongThe stream of time, with such a buoyancy,As shall endure when palaces and tombsAre swept away like dust. That little word!Beshrew thy womanish heart that cannot feelIts spell!Hark! Hark! The guns! I feel it now.I am proclaimed. Before I entered here’Twas known throughout the city that I lived,And the boy-king was dead. Hark, King Rugiero!Dost hear the bells, the shouts? Oh ’tis a
						            	proudAnd glorious feeling thus at once to liveWithin a thousand bounding hearts, to hearThe strong out-gushing of that present fameFor whose uncertain dim futurityMen toil, and slay, and die! Without a crime—I thank thee still for that—Without a crime—For he’ll be happier—I am a King.Dost thou not hear Long live the King Rugiero?The shout is weak.Augment it by thy voice.Would the words choak Prince Julian? Cannot heWish long life to his Father?Live, my Father!Long live the Duke of Melfi!Live the King!Long live the King Alfonso!Now, by Heaven,Thou art still brainsick. There is a contagionIn the soft dreamy nature of that child,That thou, a soldier—I was overproudOf thee and thy young fame. That lofty browSeem’d form’d to wear a crown. Chiefly for thee—Where is the Page?Oh Father, once
							againTake pity on us all! For me! For me!Thou hast always been to me the kindest, fondest—Preventing all my wishes— I’ll not reason,I’ll not contend with thee. Here at thy feet,Prostrate in spirit as in form, I cryFor mercy! Save me from despair! from sin!Unmanly,  rise! lest in that slavish postureI treat thee as a slave.Strike an thou wilt,Thy words pierce deeper, to the very core!Strike an thou wilt; but hear me. Oh my Father,I do conjure thee, by that name, by allThe boundless love it guerdons, spare my soulThis bitterness!I’ll reign.Aye, reign indeed;Rule over mightier realms; be conquerorOf crowned passions; king of thy own mind.I’ve ever loved thee as a son,, do thisAnd I shall worship thee. I will cling to thee;Thou shalt not shake me off.Go to; thou art mad.Not yet; but thou may’st make me so.I’ll make theeThe heir of a fair crown.Not all the powersOf all the earth can force upon my browThat heritage of guilt. Cannot I die?But that were happiness. I’d rather dragA weary life beneath the silent ruleOf the stern Trappist, digging my own grave,Myself a living corse, cut off from the sweetAnd natural kindness that man shews to man;I’d rather hang, a hermit, on the steepOf horrid Etna, between snow and fire;Rather than sita crown’d and honour’d princeGuarded by children, tributaries, friends,On an usurper’s throne.I must away.We’ll talk of this anon. Where is the
							boy.Safe.Trifle not with my impatience, Julian;Produce the child. Howe’er thou may denyAllegiance to the king, obey thy father.I had a father.Ha!But he gave upFaith, loyalty, and honour, and pure fame,And his own son.My son!I loved him once,And dearly. Still too dearly! But with allThat burning, aching, passionate old loveWrestling within my breast; even face to face;Those eyes upon me; and that trembling handThrilling my very heartstrings—Take it off!In mercy, take it off!--Still I renounce thee.Thou hast no son. I have no father. GoDown to a childless grave.Even from the graveA father’s curse may reach thee, clinging to theeCold as a dead man’s shroud, shadowing thy days,Haunting thy dreams, and hanging, a thick
						            	cloud,’Twixt thee and Heaven. Then, when perchance thine ownSmall prattling pretty ones shall climb thy kneeAnd bid thee bless them, think of thy dead father,And groan as thou dost now.Hark! ’tis the hour!I must away. Back to thy chamber, son,And chuse if I shall curse thee. Did he curse me?Did he? Am I that withered, blasted wretch?Is that the fire that burns my brain? Not yet!Oh, do not curse me yet! He’s gone. The boy!The boy!Where stays the King?He’s robing to assumeThe Crown.What a gloom reigns in the Cathedral!Where are the people, who should make and graceThis pageant?’Tis too sudden.Saw ye notHow coldly, as the slow procession moved,Men’s eyes were fixed upon him? SilentlyWe passed amid dull silence. I could hearThe chink of money, which the heralds flung,Reverberate on the pavement. They, who stoopedTo gather up the coin, looked on the impressOf young Alfonso, sighed and shook their headsAs ’twere his funeral.Methinks this placeThe general tomb of his high line doth cryShame on us! The mute citizens do mourn himBetter than we.Therefore the gates are closed,And none but peers of Sicily may passThe guarded doors.Where is Prince Julian?SickHere comes the Mighty One, and the great PrelatesThat shall anoint his haughty brow; ’tis bentWith a stern joy.No! To no tapered shrine.Here, reverend Fathers, here! This is my altar:The tomb of my great ancestor, who firstWon from the Paynim this Sicilian crown,And wore it gloriously; whose name I bearAs I will bear his honour’d sceptre. Here,At this most kingly altar, will I plightMy vow to Sicily, the nuptial vowThat links my fate to her’s. Here I’ll receiveHer Barons’ answering faith. Hear me, thou shadeOf great Rugiero, whilst I swear to guardWith heart and hand the realm thy valour won,The laws thy wisdom framed—brave legacyTo prince and people! to defend their rights,To rule in truth and justice, peacefully,If peace may be; and with the awful armOf lawful power to sweep the oppressor offFrom thy blest Isle; to be the Peasants’ King—Nobles, hear that!--the Peasants’ King and yours!Look down, Ancestral Spirit, on my oath,And sanctify and bless it! Now the crown.What noise is that at the gate?Crown me, I say.’Tis fallen! Save us from the ill omen!Save usFrom thy dull hands, old dotard! Thou a Priest,And tremble at the touch of power! Give meThe crown.It fits thee not.Give me the crown,And with a steady grasp it shall endueThese throbbing brows that burn till they are boundWith that bright diadem.Stop. Place it here!This is the King! the real, the only King!The living King Alfonso!Out, foul traitor!’Tis an impostor.Look on him, Count D’Alba!Calvi, Valore, look! Ye know him well.And ye that never saw him, know ye notHis father’s lineaments? Remove thy handFrom that fair forehead. ’Tis the pallid browBent with pensiveness, the dropping eyelid,The womanish changing cheek—his very self!Look on him. Do ye know him? Do ye ownYour King?’Tis he.The boy
							himself!Now placeThe crown upon his head; and hear me swearLow at his feet, as subject, kinsman, Prince,Allegiance.Rise, dear Cousin.Father, kneel,Kneel here with me thou, his first subject, thouThe guardian of the state, kneel first, and vowThy princely fealty.Hence, abject slave!And thou, young minion—Fear not. Father, kneel!Look where thou art. This is no place, my lord,To dally with thy duty: underneathThy fathers’ sleep; above their banners waveHeavily. Death is round about us. DeathAnd Fame. Have they no voice for thee? Not one,Of one long storied line but lived and diedA pure and faithful Knight, and left his sonHonour—proud heritage! I am thine heir,And I demand that bright inheritanceUnstained, undimmed. Kneel, I implore thee! I,Thy son.Off, cursed viper!Off, ere I hurl thee on the stones!I’ve doneMy duty. Was it not my duty?Julian,Sit here by me; here on the
							steps.AgainWe must demand of thee, my Lord of Melfi,How chanced this tale of murder? Here’s our Prince,Safe and unhurt. But where’s the Assassin? WhereThe regicide? Where he that wounded thee?Demand of him.Where be these murderers?Art sure thou saw’st them, Duke? Or was’t a freakOf the deft Fay Morgana? Didst thou
							feelThe trenchant blade? Or, was the hurt thou talk’st ofA fairy wound, a phantasm? Once againI warn thee, speak.Demand Prince Julian, Sir,This work is his.He speaks not. Little King,What say’st thou?Julian saved me.Saved! From whom?From what!A king should have no memoryBut for good deeds. My lords, an it so please you,We’ll to the Palace. I’ll not wear to-dayThis crown. Some fitting season; but not now.I’m weary. Let us home.Aye, take him hence.Home with him, Count Valore. Stay by himTill I come to ye. Leave him not. Nay, Calvi,Remain. Hence with the boy.My Cousin Julian,Wilt thou not go with us?I’ve done my duty.Was’t not my duty? But look there! look there!I cannot go with thee. I am his now.All his.Uncle—Away, bright spotted worm—What, ho! the guard!My lord, where Julian isI need no guard. Question no more of this,But follow us.I do contemn myselfThat I hold silence. Warriors, kinsmen, friends,Barons of Sicily, the valiant princesOf this most fertile and thrice famous Isle,Hear me! What yonder crafty Count hath dared,With subtle question and
					          		derisive smile,To slide into a meaning, is as trueAs he is false. I would be King; I’d reignOver fair Sicily; I’d call myselfYour Sovereign, Princes; thine, Count D’Alba, thine,Calvi, and old Leanti—we were comradesMany a year in the rough path of war.And now ye know me all. I’ll be a KingFit for this warlike nation, which brooks swayOnly of men. Yon slight fair boy is bornWith a woman’s heart. Let him go tell his beadsFor us and for our kingdom, I’ll be King.I’ll lend unto that title such a name,As shall enchase this bauble with one blazeOf honour. I’ll lead on to glory, lords,And ye shall shine in the brightness of my fameAs planets round the sun. What say ye?Never!Never!Say thou, Leanti, thou’rt a soldierWorthy of the name,—a brave one! What say’st thou?If young Alfonso—Peace. Why this is well.This morning I received a tale—I’m notAn over-believer in man’s excellence;I know that in this slippery path of lifeThe firmest foot may fail; that there have beenEre now ambitious generals, grasping heirs,Unnatural kinsmen, foul usurpers, murderers!--I know that man is frail, and might have fallenTho’ Eve had never lived,—Albeit I ownThe smiling mischief’s potency. But this,This tale was made up of such several sins,All of them devilish, treason, treachery,And pitiless cruelty made murder paleWith their red shame,—I doubt not readilyWhen man and guilt are joined—but this the commonAnd general sympathy that links our kindForbade to believe. Yet now before ye all,His peers and mine, before the vacant throneHe sought to usurp, before the crown that fellAs conscious from his brow, I do arraignRugiero, Duke of Melfi, General, Peer,Regent and Prince, of Treason.Treason! D’Alba.We quarrel not for words. Let these but followAnd bold emprise shall bear a happier name.Sicilians, have ye lost your Island spirit?Barons, is your ancient bravery tamed downBy this vain scoffer? I’ll to the people. TheyLove their old soldier.Stop. Duke, I arraign theeOf murder; planned, designed, attempted murder,Though incomplete, on the thrice sacred personOf young Alfonso, kinsman, ward, and King.Wilt thou defend this too? Was’t a brave deedTo draw the assassin’s sword on that poor child?Seize him!Come near who dares! Where be thy proofs?Where be thy witnesses?There’s one. Prince Julian,Rouse thee!He sits erect and motionlessAs yon ancestral image. Doth he breathe?Rouse thee, and answer, as before thy God,As there is truth in Heaven. Didst thou not seeThy father’s sword at young Alfonso’s breast?Lay not the boy, already dead with fear,At his false guardian’s feet? Answer!Aye, speak,Prince Julian! Dost thou falter now? On, on,And drive the dagger home! On, on, I say.We wait your Highness’ answer.Which among yeDares question me? What are ye, Sirs?The States of Sicily.The States! Without a head!Without a King! Without a Regent! States!The States! Are ye the States that ’gainst all formOf justice or of guardian law drive onTo bloody trial, him your Greatest? Here, too!Here! Will ye build up scaffolds in your churches?And turn grave priests to beadsmen? I’ll not answer.The rack may force thee.He but smiles. ConveyThe Duke to the Hall of Justice. We shall follow.Go summon Juan Castro thither. Hence!Why loiter ye?A word with thee, Prince Julian.I pray ye, listen, ’tis no treason, lords.I would but say, finish thy work. Play wellThe part that thou hast chosen. Cast asideAll filial yearnings. Be a gallant foe.Rush onward through the fight. Trample me down.Tread on my neck. Be perfect in that qualityWhich thou call’st justice. Quell thy womanish weakness.Let me respect the enemy, whom onceI thought my Son.Once, Father!I’m no Father!Rouse not my soul to curse thee! Tempt me notTo curse thy Mother—She whom once I deemedA saint in purity; Be resolute,Falter not with them. Lie not.Did I ever?Finish thy work. On, soldiers!Answer, Prince!The Duke, as thou hast heard, disclaims thee.Dare notA man of ye say that. I am his son—Tremble lest my sword should prove me so;—a partOf his own being. He gave me this life,These senses, these affections. The quick bloodThat knocks so strongly at my heart is his—Would I might spill it for him! Had ye no fathers,Have ye no sons, that ye would train men upIn parricide? I will not answer ye.This passion is thy answer. Could’st thou sayNo; in that simple word were more comprisedThan in a world of fiery eloquence.Canst thou not utter No? ’Tis short and easy,The first sound that a stuttering babe will lispTo his fond nurse,—yet thy tongue stammers at it!I ask him if his father be at onceTraitor and Murderer, and he cannot say,No!Subtle blood-thirsty fiend! I’ll answerTo nought that thou canst ask. Murderer! The kingLives. Seek of him. One truth I’ll tell thee, D’Alba,And then the record of that night shall passDown to the grave in silence. But one swordWas stained with blood in yonder glen—’twas mine!I am the only guilty. This I swearBefore the all-seeing God, whose quenchless gazePierced through that twilight hour. Now condemnThe Duke of Melfi an ye dare! I’ll speakNo more on this foul question.Thou the guilty?Thou!I have said it.I had heard a tale—This must be sifted.In that twilight hourA mortal eye beheld them. An old Spaniard,One of the guard—By Heaven it is a taleSo bloody, so unnatural, man may scarceBelieve it!And the king still lives.Why, ’tisA mystery. Let’s to the Hall of JusticeAnd hear this soldier. Sir, they are ambitious,Father & son—We can pass judgment there,This is no place;—Leanti, more ambitiousThan thou canst guess.Aye, by a thousand fold!I am an eaglet born, and can drink inThe sunlight, when the blinking owls go darkling,Dazzled and blinded by the day. Ambitious!I have had day dreams would have shamed the visionsOf that great Master of the world, who weptFor other worlds to conquer. I’d have livedAn age of sinless glory, and gone downStoried and epitaphed and chronicled,To the very end of time. Now—But I stillMay suffer bravely, may die as a Prince,A Man. Ye go to judgment. Lords, rememberI am the only guilty.We must needsOn such confession, give you into chargeA prisoner. Ho! Captain.Goes he with us?No; for the hall is near, and they are bestQuestioned apart. Walk by me, good Leanti,And I will shew thee why.Is’t possibleThat Julian stabb’d his father?No. Thou saw’stThey met as friends; no! no!Where is he? Where?Julian!Fair Princess—Stay me not. My Julian!Oh, how she sinks her head upon his arm!How her curls kiss his cheek! and her white handLies upon his! The cold and sluggish husband!He doth not clasp that loveliest hand, which natureFashioned to gather roses, or to holdBunches of bursting grapes.Count D’Alba, see,We are alone. Wilt thou not come?Anon.Now he hath seized her hand, hath dared to grasp,He shall not hold it long.They’ll wait us, Count.That white hand shall be mine.My Annabel,Why art thou here?They said—I was a foolThat believed them!—Constance said she heard a cry,Down with the Melfi! and the rumour ranThat there had been a fray, that thou wast slain.But thou art safe, my Julian?As thou seest.Thou art breathless still.Aye. I flew through the streets,Piercing the crowds like light. I was a fool;But thou had’st left me on a sudden, bearingThe young Alfonso with thee, high resolveFixed in thine eye. I knew not—Love is
									fearful;And I have learnt to fear.Thou tremblest still.The Church is cold and lonely; and that seat,At the foot of yon grim warrior, all too dampFor thee. I like not thus to see thee, Julian,Upon a tomb. Thou must submit thee stillTo thy poor nurse. Home! By the way thou’lt tell
									meWhat hath befallen. Where is Alfonso?SayThe King! the rightful, the acknowledged King!Annabel, this rude stone’s effigyOf the founder of our line; the gallant chiefWho swept away the Saracen, and quelledFierce civil broils; and, when the people’s choiceCrowned him, lived guardian of their rights, and diedWept by them as a father. And methinksTo-day I do not shame my ancestor;I dare to sit here at his feet, and feelHe would not spurn his son. Thou dost not grieveTo lose a crown, my fairest?Oh no! no!I’m only proud of thee. Thy fame’s my crown.Not fame but conscience is the enduring crown,And wearing that impearled, why to lose fameOr life were nothing.Where’s thy father, Julian?Forgive me, I have pained thee.No. The pangIs mastered. Where? He is a prisonerBefore the States. I am a prisoner here.These are my guards. Be calmer, Sweetest. Rend notThis holy place with shrieks.They seek thy life!They’ll sentence thee! They’ll kill thee! No! they shall not,Unless they kill me first. What crime—O God,To talk of crime and thee!--What falsest
						            	chargeDare they to bring?Somewhat of yon sad nightThey know.Where’s Theodore? The page? The King?Doth he accuse thee too?Poor gentle Cousin!He is as innocent as thou.I’ll fetch him.We’ll go together to the States. We’ll save thee.We, feeble though we be, woman and boy,We’ll save thee. Hold me not!Where would’st thou go?To the States.And there?I’ll tell the truth, the truth,The irresistible truth! Let go. A momentMay cost thy life,—our lives. Nothing but truth,That’s all thy cause can need. Let go.And he,My father?What’s a thousand such as he,To thee, my husband! But he shall be safe.He is thy father. I’ll say nought can harm him.He was ever kind to me! I’ll pray for him.Nay, an thou fear’st me, Julian, I’ll not speakOne word; I’ll only kneel before them all,Lift up my hands, and pray in my inmost heart,As I pray to God.My loving wife, to HimPray, to Him only. Leave me not, my dearest;There is a peace around us in this pause,This interval of torture. I’m contentAnd strong to suffer. Be thou—Ha! returnedAlready! This is quick. But I’m prepared.The sentence!Tell it not! Ye are his Judges.Ye have the power of life and death. Your wordsAre fate. Oh speak not yet! Listen to me.Aye; a long summer day! What would’st thou?Save him!Save him!He shall not die.Now bless thee, D’Alba!Bless thee! He’s safe! He’s free!Once more I askHis doom, for that is mine. If ye have dared,In mockery of justice, to arraignAnd sentence your great Ruler, with less pauseThan a petty thief taken in the manner, what’sOur doom?Sir, our great ruler (we that love notLaw’s tedious circumstance may thank him) sparedAll trial by confession. He avowedTreason and regicide; and all that thouHadst said or might say, he avouched unheardFor truth, then cried; as thou hast done, for judgment,For death.I can die too.A milder doomUnites ye. We have spared the royal blood.Only the blood. Estates and honours allAre forfeit to the King; the assembled statesBanish ye; the most holy Church declares yeBeneath her ban. This is your sentence, Sir.A Herald waits to read it in the streetsBefore ye, and from out the city gateTo thrust ye, outlawed, excommunicate,Infamous amongst men. Ere noon to-morrowYe must depart from Sicily; on painOf death to ye the outlaws, death to allThat harbour ye, death to whoe’er shall giveFood, shelter, comfort, speech. So pass ye forthIn infamy!Eternal infamyRest on your heads, false judges! Outlawed! Banished!Bereft of all state and title! Thou art stillBest of the good, greatest amongst the great,My Julian! Must they die that give thee foodAnd rest and comfort? I shall comfort thee,I thy true wife! I’ll never leave thee. Never!We’ll walk together to the gate, my handIn thine, as lovers. Let’s set forth. We’ll goTogether.Aye; but not to-night. I’ll meet theeTo-morrow at the harbour.No! no! no!I will not leave thee.Cling not thus. She trembles.She cannot walk. Brave Sir, we have been comrades;There is a pity in thine eye, which wellBeseems a soldier. Take this weeping ladyTo King Alfonso. Tell the royal boyOne, who was once his Cousin and his friend,Commends her to him. Go. To-morrow, dearest,We’ll meet again. Now for the sentence. Lords,I question not your power. I submitTo all, even to this shame. Be quick! be quick!I’ve parted them at last. The livelong nightThe little King lay, like a page, beforeHer chamber door; and ever as he heardA struggling sigh within, he cried, alas!And echoed back her moan, and uttered wordsOf comfort. Happy boy.But he is goneTowards the gate: be sure to meet Prince Julian.For that I care not, so that I secureThe vision that once flitted from my graspAnd vanished like a rainbow.Yet is JulianStill dangerous.Why after noon to-day—And see the sun’s already high!--he diesIf he be found in Sicily. Take thouTwo resolute comrades to pursue his steps,Soon as the time be past. Didst thou not hearThe proclamation? Know’st thou where he bides?And Melfi?Good, my lord, ’tis said the DukeIs dead.Dead!Certain ’tis that yesternightHe walked from out the Judgment Hall like oneDreaming, with eyes that saw not, ears that heardNo sound, staggering and tottering like old ageOr infancy. And when the kingly robeWas plucked from him, and he forced from the gate,A deep wound in his side burst forth; the bloodWelled like a fountain.And he died?He fellFainting; and Julian, who had tended himSilently, with a spirit so absorbedHis own shame seemed unfelt, fell on his neckShrieking like maddening woman. There we left him,And there ’tis said he hath outwatched the night.There on the ground?So please you.Thou hast knownA softer couch, Prince Julian. Is the litterPrepared? And the old groom?My lord, he waitsYour pleasure.Call him hither.Blood welled outFrom a deep wound! Said old Leanti sooth?No matter! Either way he’s guilty.Ha!A reverend knave. Wast thou Prince Julian’s huntsman?An please you, Sir, I was.Dost know the Princess?—Doth she know thee?Full well, my Lord. I tendedPrince Julian’s favourite greyhound. It was strangeHow Lelia loved my lady,—the poor foolHath pined for her this week past,—and my ladyLoved Lelia. She would stroke her glossy head,And talk of Lelia’s beauty, Lelia’s speed,Till I was weary.And the angel deemedThis slave as faithful as her dog! The better.Dost thou love ducats, Renzi?Canst thou graceA lie with tongue and look and action?Aye.Go to the Princess; say thy master sent
							theeTo guide her to him, or the young Alfonso,—Use either name, or both. Spare not for tears,Or curses. Lead her to the litter; seeThat Constance follows not. Bertone’ll gainAdmittance for thee—Go.Bertone seek meA supple churchman;—Know’st thou any? OneNot scrupulous; one who loves gold, and laughsAt conscience. Bring him to me. I must hastenSilently home. Let not the Princess guessThat I have left the palace.No, my Lord.He wakes! He is not dead! I am not yetA parricide. I dare not look on him;I dare not speak.Water! my throat is scorched.My tongue cleaves to my mouth. Water! Will noneGo fetch me water? Am I here alone?Here on the bloody ground, as on that night—Am I there still? No! I remember now.Yesterday I was King; to-day, I’m nothing;Cast down by my own son; stabbed in my fame;Branded and done to death; an outlaw whereI ruled! He, whom I loved with such a pride,With such a fondness, hath done this; and I,I have not strength to drag me to his presenceThat I might rain down curses on his head,Might blast him with a look.Here’s water. Drink!What voice is that? Why dost thou shroud thy face?Dost shame to shew thyself? Who art thou?Drink.I pray thee drink.Is’t poison?’Tis the pureAnd limpid gushing of a natural springClose by yon olive ground. A little child,Who stood beside the fount, watching the brightAnd many-coloured pebbles, as they seemedTo dance in the bubling water, filled for meHer beechen cup, with her small innocent hand,And bade our Lady bless the draught! Oh drink!Have faith in such a blessing!Thou should’st bringNothing but poison. Hence, accursed cup!I’ll perish in my thirst. I know thee, Sir.Father!I have no son. I had one once,A gallant gentleman; but he—What, Sir,Didst thou never hear of that Sicilian Prince,Who made the fabulous tale of Greece a truth,And slew his father? The old Laius fellAt once, unknowing and unknown; but thisNew Œdipus, he stabbed and stabbed and stabbed,And the poor wretch cannot die.I think my heartIs iron that it breaks not.I should curse him—And yet—Dost thou not know that I’m an outlaw,Under the ban? They stand in danger, Sir,That talk to me.I am an outlaw too.Thy fate is mine. Our sentence is alike.What! have they banished thee?I should have gone,In very truth, I should have gone with thee,Aye to the end of the world.What banish thee!Oh, foul ingratitude! Weak changeling boy!He knows it not. Father, this banishmentCame as a comfort to me, set me freeFrom warring duties and fatiguing cares,And left me wholly thine. We shall be happy;For she goes with us, who will prop thy steps,As once the maid of Thebes, Antigone,In that old tale. Chuse thou whatever land,—All are alike to us. But pardon me!Say thou hast pardoned me!My virtuous son!Oh thanks to thee and Heaven! He sinks; he’s faint;His lips wax pale. I’ll seek the spring once more:’Tis thirst.What music’s that?I hear none.Hark!Thou art weak and dizzy.Angels of the air,Cherub and Seraph sometimes watch aroundThe dying, and the mortal sense, at pause’Twixt life and death, doth drink in a faint echoOf heavenly harpings?I have heard so.Aye;But they were just men, Julian! They were holy.They were not traitors.Strive against these thoughts—Thou wast a brave man, Father!--fight against them,As ’gainst the Paynims thy old foes. He growsPaler and paler. Water from the spring;Or generous wine;—I saw a cottage near.Rest thee, dear Father, till I come.AgainThat music! It is mortal; it draws nearer.No. But if men should pass, must I lie hereLike a crushed adder? Here in the highwayTrampled beneath their feet?—So! So! I’ll crawlTo yonder bank. Oh that it were the deckOf some great Admiral, and I aloneBoarding amidst a hundred swords! the breachOf some strong citadel, and I the firstTo mount in the cannon’s mouth! I was brave once.Oh for the common undistinguished deathOf battle, pressed by horse’s heels, or crushedBy falling towers! And thing but to lieHere like a leper!’Tis the spot where Julian—And yet I see him not. I’ll pause awhile;’Tis likely he’ll return. I’ll wait.My liege,You’re sad to day.I have good cause to be so.Nay, nay, cheer up.Didst thou not tell me, Sir,That my poor Uncle’s banished, outlawed, laidUnder the church’s ban?He would have slainHis Sovereign.I ne’er said it. YesterdayI found you at his feet. Oh, would to HeavenThat crown were on his head, and I—What’s that?The moaning wind.He was a traitor, Sire,He was my kinsman still. And Julian! Julian!My Cousin Julian! he who saved my life,Whose only crime it was to be too good,Too great, too well beloved,—to banish him!To tear him from my arms!Sire, he confessed—Ye should have questioned me. Sirs, I’m a boy,A powerless, friendless boy, whose name is usedTo cover foul oppression. If I liveTo grasp a sword—but ye will break my heartBefore that hour. Whence come those groans?
										Seeing Melfi. My UncleStretched on the ground, and none to tend thee! RestThy head upon my arm. Where’s Julian? SureI thought to find him with thee. Nay, be still;Strive not to move.I fain would kneel to theeFor pardon.Listen not, my liege. The StatesSentenced the Duke of Melfi; thou hast notThe power to pardon. Leave him to his fate.’Twere best your Highness came with us.AvoidThe place! Leave us, cold, courtly lords! AvoidMy sight! Leave us, I say. Send instant succour,Food, water, wine, and men with hearts, if courtsMay breed such. Leave us.Gallant boy!Alas!I have no power.For all I need thou hast.Give me but six feet of Sicilian earth,And thy sweet pardon.Talk not thus. I’ll growAt once into a man, into a king,And they shall tremble, and turn pale with fear.Who now have dared—Julian!Here’s water. Ha!Alfonso! I thought Pity had been dead.I craved a little wine, for the dear loveOf Heaven, for a poor dying man; and allTurned from my prayer. Drink, I have sentFor succour.Gentle heart!The time is past.Music again.Aye; ’tis a shepherd’s pipeFrom yonder craggy mountain. How it swingsUpon the wind, now pausing, now renewed,Regular as a bell.A passing bell.Cast off these heavy thoughts.Turn me.He bleeds!The blood wells out.It eases me.He sinks!He dies! Off! he’s my father. Rest on me.Bless thee.Oh, no! no! no! I cannot bearThy blessing. Twice to stab, and twice forgiven—Oh curse me rather!Bless ye both!He’s dead,And surely he died penitent. That thoughtHath in it a deep comfort. The freed spiritGushed out in a full tide of pardoning love.He blest us both, my Julian; even meAs I had been his son. We’ll pray for himTogether, and thy Annabel shall joinHer purest orisons. I left her stretchedIn a deep slumber. All night long she watchedAnd wept for him and thee; but now she sleeps.Shall I go fetch her? She, better than I,Would soothe thee. Dost thou hear? He writhes as thoughThe struggling grief would choke him. Rouse thee. Julian,Calm thee. Thou frighten’st me.Am I not calm?There is my sword. Go.I’ll not leave thee.King!Dost thou not see we’ve killed him? Thou had’st cause;But I, that was his Son.—Home to thy Palace!Home!Let me stay beside thee; I’ll not speak,Nor look, nor move. Let me but sit and dropTear for tear with thee.Go.My Cousin Julian—Madden me not. I’m excommunicate,An exile, and an outlaw, but a man.Grant me the human privilege to weepAlone o’er my dead father. King, I savedThy life. Repay me now a thousand-fold,—Go.Aye; for a sweet comforter.My liege,The lady Annabel—What? is she dead?Have I killed her?Speak, Paolo. In thy chargeI left her.Is she dead?No. Heaven forefend!But she hath left the Palace.’Tis the curseOf blood that’s on my head; on all I love.She’s lost.Did she go forth alone?My liege,Prince Julian’s aged Huntsman, Renzi, came,Sent, as he said, by thee, to bear her whereHer Lord was sheltered.Hoary traitor!SheFollowed him, nothing fearing; and I tooHad gone, but D’Alba’s servants closed the gates,And then my heart misgave me.Where’s my sword?I’ll rescue her! I’ll save her!Hast thou tracedThy lady?No, my liege. But much I fear—Certain a closed and guarded litter tookThe way to the western suburb.There, where liesThe palace of Count D’Alba! Stained—defiled—He hath thee now, my lovely one! There’s stillA way—Let me but reach thee! One asylum—One bridal bed—One resting place. All griefsAre lost in this. Oh would I lay as thou, My Father! Leave him not in the high-wayFor dogs to mangle. He was once a Prince.Farewell!Let me go with thee.No. This deedIs mine.Paolo stay by the corse. I’ll after,He shall not on this desperate quest alone.Rather, my liege, seek D’Alba:— I deemHe still is at thy Palace. Watch him well.Stay by him closely. So may the sweet ladyBe rescued, and Prince Julian saved.Thou’rt right.Leave her with me. Guard well the gate; and watchThat none approach the tower.Fair Annabel!Who is it calls? Where am I? Who art thou?Why am I here? Now heaven preserve me, D’Alba!Where’s Julian? Where’s Prince Julian? Where’s my husband?Renzi, who lured me from the palace, sworeIt was to meet my husband.Many an oathFirst sworn in falsehood turns to truth. He’s here.Calm thee, sweet lady.Where? I see him not.Julian!Another husband.Then he’s dead!He’s dead!He lives.Heard I aright? Again!There is a deafening murmur in mine ears,Like the moaning sound that dwells in the
							sea shell,So that I hear nought plainly. Say’t again.He lives.Now, thanks to Heaven! Take me to him.Where am I?In an old and lonely towerAt the end of my poor orchard.Take me home.Thou hast no home.No home! His arms! his heart!Take me to him.Sweet Annabel, be still.Conquer this woman’s vain impatiency,And listen. Why she trembles as I wereSome bravo. Oh that man’s free heart should bowTo a fair cowardice! Listen. Thou know’stThe sentence of the Melfi?Aye, the unjustAnd wicked doom that ranked the innocentWith the guilty. But I murmur not. I loveTo suffer with him.He is banished; outlawed,Cut off from every human tie;—Not all.I am his wife.Under the Church’s ban.I tell thee, Annabel, that learned Priest,The sage Anselmo, deems thou art releasedFrom thy unhappy vows; and will to night—Stop. I was wedded in the light of dayIn the great church at Naples. Blessed day!I am his wife; bound to him ever moreIn sickness, penury, disgrace. Count D’Alba,Thou dost misprize the world, but thou must knowThat woman’s heart is faithful, and clings closestIn misery.If the Church proclaim thee free—Sir, I will not be free; and if I wereI’d give myself to Julian o’er again—Only to Julian! Trifle thus no longer.Lead me to him. Release me.Now, by heaven,I’ll bend this glorious constancy. I’ve known theeEven from a little child, and I have seenThat stubborn spirit broken: not by fear,That thou can’st quell; nor interest; nor ambition;But love! love! love! I tell thee, Annabel,One whom thou lov’st, stands in my danger. Wed meThis very night—I will procure a priestAnd dispensations, there shall nothing lackOf nuptial form—Wed me, or look  to hearOf bloody justice.My poor father, Melfi!The Regent? He is dead.God hath been merciful.Is there no other name? no dearer?Ha!Hadst thou such tender love for this proud father,Who little recked of thee, or thy fair looks;—Is all beside forgotten?Speak!Why, Julian!Julian, I say!He is beyond thy power.Thanks, thanks, great God! He’s ruined, exiled, strippedOf name, and land, and titles. He’s as dead.Thou hast no power to harm him. He can fallNo deeper. Earth hath not a lowlier stateThan princely Julian fills.Doth not the graveLie deeper?What? But thou hast not the power!Hast thou? Thou canst not. Oh be pitiful!Speak, I conjure thee, speak!Didst thou not hearThat he was exiled, outlawed, banished farFrom the Sicilian Isles, on pain of death.If, after noon to-day, he e’er were seenIn Sicily? The allotted bark awaits;The hour is past; and he is here.Now heavenHave mercy on us! D’Alba, at thy feet,Upon my bended knees—Oh pity! pity!Pity and pardon! I’ll not rise. I cannot.I cannot stand more than a creeping wormWhilst Julian’s in thy danger. Pardon him!Thou wast not cruel once. I’ve seen thee turnThy step from off the path to spare an insect;I’ve marked thee shudder, when my falcon struckA panting bird;—though thou hast tried to sneerAt thy own sympathy. D’Alba, thy heartIs kinder than thou knowest. Save him, D’Alba!Save him!Be mine.Am I not his?Be mine;And he shall live to the whole age of manUnharmed.I’m his.—Oh—Oh spare him!--Only his.Then it is thou that dost enforce the lawOn Julian; thou, his loving wife, that guid’stThe officer to seize him where he liesUpon his father’s corse; thou that dost
							leadThy husband to the scaffold;—thou his wife,His loving wife! Thou yet may’st rescue him.Now, God forgive thee, man! Thou torturest meWorse than a thousand racks. But thou art notSo devilish, D’Alba. Thou hast talked of love;—Would’st see me die here at thy feet? Have mercy!Mercy! Aye, such as thou hast shewn to meThrough weeks and months and years. I was born strongIn scorn, the wise man’s passion. I had livedAloof from the juggling world, and with a stringWatched the poor puppets ape their several parts;Fool, knave, or madman; till thy fatal charms,Beautiful mischief, made me knave and foolAnd madman; brought revenge and love and hateInto my soul. I love and hate thee, lady,And doubly hate myself for loving thee.But, by this teeming earth, this starry Heaven,And by thyself the fairest stubbornest thingThe fair stars shine upon, I swear to-nightThou shalt be mine. If willingly, I’ll savePrince Julian;—but still mine. Speak. Shall he live?Canst thou not speak? Wilt thou not save him?No.Did she die with the word! Dost hear me, lady?I asked thee wouldst thou save thy husband?No. Not so! Not so!’Tis well.Stay! Stay! He’s gone.Count D’Alba! Save him! Save him! D’Alba’s gone,And I have sentenced him.He would have chosen so,Would rather have died a thousand deaths than soHave lived! Oh who will succour me, shut upIn this lone tower! none but those horrid guards,And yonder hoary traitor, know where the poor,Poor Annabel is hidden; no man caresHow she may perish—only one—and he—Preserve my wits! I’ll count my beads; ’twill calm me:What if I hang my rosary from the casement?There is a brightness in the gorgeous jewelTo catch men’s eyes, and haply, some may passThat are not pitiless. This window’s closed;But in yon chamber—Ah, ’tis open! ThereI’ll hang the holy gem, a guiding star,A visible prayer to man and God. Oh save meFrom sin and shame! Save him! I’ll hang it there.I cannot rest. I wander to and froWithin my dreary prison, as to seekFor comfort and find none. Each hour hath killedA hope that seemed the last. The shadows pointUpward. The sun is sinking. Guard me, heaven,Through this dread night!What evil sound—All soundsAre evil here! Is there some murder doing?Or wantonly in sport.Annabel!Julian!My wife! Art thou still mine?Thine own.She smiles!She clings to me! Her eyes are fixed on mineWith the old love, the old divinest lookOf innocence! It is yet time. She’s pure!She’s undefiled!--Speak to me, Annabel.Tremble not so.’Tis joy. Oh I have beenSo wretched! And to see thee when I thoughtWe ne’er should meet again! How didst thou find me?The rosary! the blessed rosaryShone in the sun-beam, like a beacon fire,A guiding star! Thrice holy was its lightThat led me here to save—Oh blessings on thee!How? Where? what way? The iron door is barred!Where didst thou enter Julian!Through the casementOf yonder chamber.What? that grim ascent!That awful depth! Didst thou dare this for me?And must I?—But I fear not. I’ll go with thee.I’m safe of foot, and light. I’ll go.Thou canst not.Then go thyself, or he will find thee here,He and his ruffian band. Let us part now.Kiss me again. Fly, fly from Sicily!—That fearful man—but he is all one lie—Told me thy life was forfeited.He told theeA truth.Oh fly! fly! fly;My AnnabelThe bloodhounds that he laid upon the scentHave tracked me hither. Didst thou hear a gun?For once the ball passed harmless.Art thou hurt?Art sure thou art not?Yes. But they who aimedThat death are on the watch. Their quarry’s lodged.We can escape them—one way—only one!How? What way?Ask not.Whither?To—my father.Then he’s alive—Oh happiness! They told meThat he was dead. Why do we loiter here?Let’s join him now.Not yet.Now! now! Thou know’st notHow horribly these walls do picture to meThe several agonies whereof my soulHath drunk to day. I have been tempted, Julian,By one—a fiend! tempted till I almost thoughtGod had forsaken me. But thou art hereTo save me, and my pulse beats high againWith love and hope. I am light-hearted now,And could laugh like a child—only these wallsDo crowd around me with a visible weight,A palpable pressure; giving back the formsOf wildest thoughts that wandered through my brainBright chattering Madness, and sedate Despair,And fear the Great Unreal!—Take me hence!Take me away with thee!Not yet, not yet.Thou sweetest wretch! I cannot—Dotard! Fool!I must. Not yet! not yet!—Talk to me, Annabel;This is the hour when thou wast wont to makeEarth Heaven with lovely words; the sun-set hour,That woke thy spirit into joy. Once moreTalk to me, Annabel.Aye, all day long,When we are free. Thy voice is choked; thy looksAre not on me; thy hand doth catch and twitchAnd grasp mine painfully,—that gentle hand!O God! O God! that right hand!--kiss it not!Take thy lips from it!Canst thou save me, Julian?Thou always dost speak truth. Canst save thyself?Shall we go hence together?Aye, one fate—One home.Why that is bliss. We shall be poor—Shall we not, Julian? I shall have a joyI never looked for; I shall work for thee,Shall tend thee, be thy Page, thy ’Squire, thy all,—Shall I not, Julian.Annabel, look forthUpon this glorious world! Look once againOn our fair Sicily, lit by that sunWhose level beams do cast a golden shineOn sea, and shore, and city, on the prideOf bowery groves; on Etna’s smouldering top;—Oh bright and glorious world! and thou of allCreated things most glorious, tricked in light,As the stars that live in Heaven!Why dost thou gazeSo sadly on me.The bright stars, how oftThey fall, or seem to fall! The Sun—look! look!He sinks, he sets in glory. Blessed orb,Like thee—like thee—Dost thou remember onceWe sate by the sea shore when all the HeavenAnd all the ocean seemed one glow of fireRed, purple, saffron, melted into oneIntense and ardent flame, the doubtful lineWhere sea and sky should meet was lost in thatContinuous brightness; there we sate and talkedOf the mysterious union that blessed orbWrought between earth and heaven, of life and death—High mysteries!--and thou didst wish thyselfA spirit sailing in that flood of lightStraight to the Eternal Gates, didt pray to passAway in such a glory. Annabel!Look out upon the burning sky, the seaOne lucid ruby—’tis the very hour!Thou’lt be a Seraph at the Fount of LightBefore—What must I die? And wilt thou kill me?Canst thou? Thou cam’st to save—To save thy honour!I shall die with thee.Oh, no! no! live! live!If I must die—Oh it is sweet to live,To breathe, to move, to feel the throbbing bloodBeat in the veins,—to look on such an earthOn such a Heaven,—to look on thee! Young lifeIs very dear.Would’st live for D’Alba?No!I had forgot. I’ll die. Quick! Quick!One kiss!Angel, dost thou forgive me?Yes.My sword!—I cannot draw it.Now! I’m ready.Seize him!Yield thee, Prince Julian! Yield thee! Seize the lady.Oh fatal, fond delay! Dare not come near us!Stand off! I’ll guard thee, sweet. But when I fallLet him not triumph.Yield thee!Strike him down.Thou canst die then, my fairest.Now!For thee!For thee. ’Tis sweet!Fiend, hast thou slain her? Die! die! die!Come on. fights and kills him.
                  Call instant help! Hasten the Count!My wife!My murdered wife! Doth she not breathe? I thought—My sight is dim—Oh no!she’s pale! she’s cold!She’s still!--If she were living she would speakTo comfort me. She’s mute! she’s stiff! she’s—dead!Why do I shiver at the word, that amDeath’s factor, peopler of unhallowed graves,Slayer of all my race! not thee! not thee!God, in his mercy, guided the keen swordTo thy white bosom.—I could not. Lie there.I’ll shroud thee in my mantle.The rude earthWill veil thy beauty next. One kiss!--She diedTo save me!--One kiss, Annabel! I slewThe slave that killed thee,—but the fiend—the
									cause—Is he not coming?—I will chain in lifeTill I’ve avenged thee; I could slay an armyNow, in my strong despair. But that were mercy.He must wear daggers in his heart. He loved her;—I’ll feed his hopes, and then—Aye—ha! ha! ha!That will be a revenge to make the fiendsLaugh—ha! ha! ha! I’ll wrap me in this cloakAnd in the twilight—So!—He will not knowMy voice—it frightens me!--I have not hiddenThee quite, my Annabel! There is one tressFloating in springy grace—as if—she’s dead!She’s dead! I must not gaze, for then my heartWill break before its time. He comes. The stairsGroan at his pressure.Back, and watch the gate!--All’s tranquil. Where’s the traitor?Dead.Who slew him?I.And the lady,—where is she?At rest.Fair Gentleness! After this perilous stormShe needs must lack repose.I’ll wait her here.Friend! thou hast done good service to the stateAnd me; we’re not ungrateful. Julian’s swordFails him not often; and the slave who fledProclaimed him Victor.He slew two.And thouSlew’st him? Aye there he lies in the ermined cloakOf royalty, his haughty shroud! Six ellsOf rude uncostly linen serves to wrapYour common corse; but this man was born swathedIn regal purple; lived so; and so died.So be he buried. Let not mine enemyCall me ungenerous. Roll him in his ermineAnd dig a hole without the city gateFor him and the proud Regent. Quick! I’d haveThe funeral speedy. Ah! the slaughtering swordLies by him, brown with clotted gore. Hence! hence!And drag the carrion with thee.Wilt thou notLook on the corse?I cannot wait her waking.I must go feast my eyes on her fair looks—Divinest Annabel! My widowed bride!--Where is she?There. Now gaze thyself to Hell!Gloat with hot love upon that beauteous dust!—She’s safe! She’s dead!Julian!But touch her notShe’s mine.Oh perfectest and loveliest thing!Eternal curses rest upon his headWho murdered thee!Off! off! Pollute her not!She’s white! She’s pure!--Curses! Now curse for curseOn the foul murderer! On him who turnedThe sweet soul from her home, who slew her father,Hunted her husband as a beast of prey,Pursued, imprisoned, lusted, left no gateOpen save that to Heaven!—Off! gaze not on her!Thy look is profanation!Here, Leanti!This way! Oh sight of horror! Julian! Julian!The Princess dead! Why D’Alba—Seize him guards.Lead him before the States. This bloody sceneCalls for deep vengeance.If I were not wearyOf a world that sweats under a load of fools—Old creaking vanes that turn as the wind changes—Lords, I’d defy ye! I’d live on for ever!And I defy ye now. For she is gone—The glorious vision!--and the Patriarch’s yearsWere valueless. Do with me as ye will;—Ye cannot call back her.Off with him!Julian! Wilt thou not speak?I have been thanking heavenThat she is dead.His wits are gone.My JulianLook on me. Dost thou know me? I’m thy Cousin,Thy comforter.She was my Comforter!And now—But I do know thee; thou’rt the King;The pretty boy I loved—She loved thee too!I’m glad thou’rt come to close my eyes. Draw nearerThat I may see thy face. Where art thou?Here!Poor child he weeps! Send for the honoured deadBeside the city gate,—he pardoned me!Bury us in one grave,—all in one grave!I did not kill herStrew her with white flowers,For she was innocent.Cheer thee! Take hope!Raise up his head.My Julian!He forgave me,—Thou know’st he did.—White flowers! Nothing but white!He’s gone!And I am left in the wide worldAlone. My Julian!
