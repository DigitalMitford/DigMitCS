		SCENE---At and near Mirandola, in Italy.
		ACT I.
			SCENE I.
				The outer yard of an inn on the road to Mirandola.
				
					Beatrice enters from the Inn. 
				Bea.
					I thought I heard the trampling of horses.Marco!---There are so few
						travellers who pass this road,that really we must make the most of all who
						come.Hark! that was certainly a horse's step.---Marco!---There, again:
						somebody is certainly coming.She listens.
				
					Marco enters. 
				Marco.
					By Saint Peter, this will be a rare day togo to sleep in. There'll be
						nothing awake to-day butthe sun, and my wife. Why, Beatrice, what's the
						matter?Are you bent double before your time? Shelooks like Fine-ear, in the
						Fairy tale, who listens to hearthe grass grow.
						Beatrice!Beatrice.
					Hark! don't you hear?Marco.
					Hear? no: and yet---Ha! I do hear somethingnow. Some travellers, I
						suppose: yes, they are now almost close to us. They stop. Ah! there they
						areat the end of the orchard.---Go in, go in and preparebreakfast for them.
						There never yet was a travellerwho had'nt a good appetite.
				
					Beatrice goes in.
				A good clever girl that, tho' she talks more than she need at times; but,
					what!---there's no one perfect. Now if these gallants should be coming to the
					merry-making at Court, which was held yesterday, in honor of the Duke's marriage
					that happened some time ago, why they'll be a day too late, that's all.---So,
					who is this?
				
					Andrea enters. 
				Andrea.
					 Are you the landlord of this
						house?Marco.
					I am.Andrea.
					The Duke's son, Lord Guido, is here on hisway home from Naples. Get some
						refreshment ready,and be quick.Marco.
					The Duke's son?Andrea.
					Yes.---Why what's the matter? The Duke'sson, I
						said.Marco.
					What he who died?Andrea.
					Died!---Nonsense! how could he be here ifhe died? he was only
						wounded.Marco.
					Not dead? that's odd. Is he coming to theCourt
						feast?Andrea.
					We've heard of no feast. What is it for?Is any body married, or
						dead?Marco.
					Hush! your master's here.---Beatrice!
				
					Guido, Casti , and Julio enter. 
				Julio.
					Ah! Signior Casti, you were gallant ever, 
					At home and in the field.---Here, fellow; shew 
					Our servants where the horses may be housed.
				
					Beatrice enters. 
				Marco.
					I will, my lord.
				Casti.
					Take care of mine,---a grey.
				Guido.
					This is the prettiest girl that I have seen 
					Since I left Naples.
				Bea.
					Oh! my lord.
				Casti.
					You have forgot poor Bayard.
				Guido.
					No, indeed. Good fellow, 
					Go with this man, and he will show you where 
					A berry-brown horse is panting, wet and white 
					With foam.---Carlo's gone onwards?
				Serv.
					Yes, my lord.
				Guido.
					That horse---he is a friend of mine, (the best 
					That ever bore a man thro' blood and death;) 
					Take excellent care of him as you expect 
					Requital. 
					
						Marco and Servant exeunt. 
					Thanks, good Casti, many thanks: 
					Old Bayard too should thank you if he could.
				Julio.
					Now, hostess, we are hungry travellers: go 
					And strip your larder of it's best: we come 
					With desperate thoughts against it.
				Guido.
					Pretty hostess! 
					Areyouthe hostess of this pleasant place?
				Beat.
					Yes, my lord, yes.
				Casti.
					You make her blush.
				Julio.
					No more.---Good hostess, hie thou in and quickly make 
					The best of preparation: we shall be 
					With thee anon.
					
						Beatrice exit. 
				Guido.
					We shall come to thee soon.
				Julio.
					Why, my dear lord, this peasant seems to take 
					Your fancy.
				Guido.
					Oh! I like a pretty face 
					At court or in a cottage.
				Casti.
					And in camp?
				Guido.
					No; there one's thoughts are taught to swerve 
					From their more natural bent.---I hate the camp. 
					I hate it's noise and stiff parade,---it's blank 
					And empty forms, and stately courtesy. 
					Where between bows and blows, a smile and a stab, 
					There's scarce a moment. Soldiers always live 
					In idleness or peril: both are bad.
				Casti.
					I fear that you are right, indeed.
				Julio.
					How! right?
				Guido.
					I am.--- 
					Give me an intellectual nobler life; 
					Not fighting like the herded elephants, which, 
					Beckon'd by some fierce slave, go forth to war, 
					And trample in the dust their fellow brute. 
					But letmelive amongst high thoughts and smiles
					As beautiful as love; with grasping hands, 
					And a heart that flutters with diviner life 
					Whene'er my step is heard.
				Julio.
					Why, what is this?
				Casti.
					A picture of a happier lot, dear friend, 
					Than you and I have known.
				Julio.
					Had I not seen 
					You both fight bravely,---better than myself, 
					I should have doubted you.---What! rail at war--- 
					Bright eyed Bellona?---Oh! for shame, for shame! 
					I must forswear your company, my Lord. 
					For me, I like all folks who follow war, 
					Down to the very suttler: I am even 
					Friend to the commissary.
				Guido.
					Ay, when you run 
					In debt.
				Casti.
					With empty pockets.
				Guido.
					Or---or when 
					He feasts his friends.
				Casti.
					Or falls in love, and wishes 
					To give a trifle to some girl.
				Guido.
					Indeed, heistoo much addicted---while I speak,
					I grieve to talk thus of him---
				Julio.
					Moral Lord! 
					Oh! this is well. Go on; and, Signior, you 
					Who smile but once a week, (then not for joy,)--- 
					You smile now; yet, you must remember ('tis
					Scarce two years since,) at Baiae, a pale girl, 
					Who lived so much in private?
				Casti.
					Spare her: nay, 
					She was unfortunate.
				Julio.
					And you?
				Guido.
					Was kind. 
					I know the story: touch not on it now. 
					It is a melancholy tale, fit only 
					For the fire-side and winter: some dull day, 
					When the clouds leave a shadow on your brow, 
					I'll tell it to you.
				Casti.
					Be content; I was 
					Her friend,---a father, but no more; believe 't.
				Julio.
					Must I? Well, be it:---but this hostess stays 
					A long time 'ere she summons us, methinks. 
					If I eat double 'tis no fault of mine. 
					I may as well go in,---and---
				Guido.
					But be civil.
				Julio.
					Civil? I'll be as loving.
				Casti.
					Ay, and brief 
					In your discourse.
				Guido.
					I shall keep watch o'er you.
				Julio.
					And th'hostess?
				Guido.
					Ay; over both wolf and lamb.
					
						Julio exit into the inn. 
				Casti.
					I never saw you in so gay a mood: 
					Have you heard news?
				Guido.
					No;---no.
				Casti.
					I fear I've marred 
					Your gaiety.
				Guido.
					Ah! no: 'twas but a trick 
					To cheat away sad folly.---I have heard 
					Nothing: my courier never, as you know, 
					Returned: my letters are unanswer'd:---From 
					My father (yet he was kind once) I might have borne 
					This fearful silence; but from her---Oh! her 
					Whom like a star I worshipped.---Pshaw! my eyes 
					Are like a girl's to-day. I've no doubt 
					But all is well.
				Casti.
					I hope so.
				Guido.
					Ay;Ihope.
					Why should I fear?---you do not fear? you know 
					Nothing, good Casti, of my love?
				Casti.
					Nothing: be calm.
				Guido.
					I know not how it is; 
					But a foreboding presses on my heart 
					At times, until I sicken.
					---I have heard,
					And from men learned, that before the touch 
					(The common, coarser touch) of good or ill,--- 
					That oftentimes a subtler sense informs 
					Some spirits of the approach of 'things to be.' 
					Fate comes before it's time; like Hope or Fear 
					Reverting on the soul, with surer aim.
				Casti.
					What more!
				Guido.
					Oh! I've a deep dull sense of pain to come 
					Clinging upon my heart.
				Casti.
					So lovers talk; 
					And feel, perhaps.
					Suspense to them is as
					A hideous ghost, changing it's shape for ever. 
					Thus in wild evenings children's fears, you know, 
					Shape devils out of shadows.---Oh! be gay. 
					Morning will soon be here, and she you sigh for 
					Will smile these dreams away.
				Guido.
					May it be so! 
					Let's talk no more of this at present.---Where 
					Is Julio?
				Casti.
					Likeliest by the cottage fire, 
					Helping the pretty hostess.
				Guido.
					Let us go. 
					You think, then, she---
				Casti.
					Oh! I think 
					Not of her; save that she is fair and true. 
					Stifle these fears: why, in some three hours hence 
					You'll see her
				Guido.
					So I shall, indeed.
				Casti.
					Let's drink 
					Her health in purest water.
				Guido.
					No: in wine.
				Casti.
					In wine then, be it. High Falernian?
				Curio.
					Ay, 
					In nectar. Why, methinks, these dreams of mine 
					Are almost banished.
				Casti.
					With yourself remains 
					The power to do't. Be lord of your own mind. 
					The dread of evil is the worst of ill; 
					A tyrant, yet a rebel, dragging down
					The clear-eyed judgment from its spiritual throne, 
					And leagued with all the base and blacker thoughts 
					To overwhelm the soul. But come, our friend 
					Waits, and---the pretty hostess.
				Guido.
					There: my hand 
					Is firm as 'tis in battle.
				Casti.
					So it is. 
					Now then: nay, go you first. I'll follow.
				Exeunt.
			SCENE II.
				A Garden of the Duke's Palace.
				Isidora, Isabella, Hypolito.
				Isab.
					Cheer thee, dear sister: nay---these mournful looks 
					Shame all our smiles.
				Hyp.
					Dear aunt!
				Isab.
					Were I the Duke, 
					I should be jealous of your grief.
				Isid.
					Madam!
				Isab.
					Indeed.---A jealous thing is happiness,--- 
					And delicate too, for round it all must be 
					Warm like itself and pleasant, else it flies; 
					Like summer birds from winter.
				Isid.
					Yesterday,--- 
					It's ceremony and toil have worn me down. 
					Forgive me for it: I am scarcely used 
					As yet to your court splendors.---I shall be 
					A Duchess shortly, such as you could wish. 
					I was not born, you know, to princely pomp, 
					And it sits ill on me. Hypolito! 
					Why areyousad, dear boy? I thought I was
					The only mocker here.
				Isab.
					'Wake, dreaming child! 
					Your aunt, the Duchess, speaks to you.
				Hyp.
					Dear Lady.
				Takes Isidora's hand.
				Isab.
					A pretty gallant: so,---in time he'll break 
					A promise smoothly.
				Isid.
					I hope not; yet there are 
					None of his faithless sex who cannot feign.
				Isab.
					Except my brother?
				Isid.
					Ay: except the Duke. 
					But come, Hypolito; I never hear 
					Now how your falcon flies, nor of the barb 
					Your uncle gave you.---How is this? it was 
					A true Arabian, was it not?
				Hyp.
					Indeed 
					I scarcely know. I have not rid of late.
				Isab.
					He keeps his chamber, like a languid girl, 
					And reads romance.---"Indeed, I scarcely know---" 
					Why that was lisped forth like a girl.---For shame! 
					What do you know then, sirrah?
				Hyp.
					Oh! I know 
					By heart, by heart, those gentle stories which 
					My Aunt (before shewasmy Aunt) gave to me,
					And told me with a smile, such as I never 
					Saw on her face again,---'These lines were strung 
					'By frenzied Tasso whom a princess scorned, 
					'And these flew forth from Ariosto's quill, 
					'And these sad Petrarch, who lamented long 
					'Laura his love, once writ; and some there were 
					'Inscribed by great Boccaccio's golden pen, 
					'Mirthful and mournful, fit for every heart.'
				Isab.
					A pretty list: and is this all you read? 
					Oh! I must look to you.---The father comes; 
					In haste, it seems. 
				
					Gheraldi enters. 
				Well, father?
				Gher.
					The fair blessing of the day 
					Rest on you all.---Madam, my duty bends 
					Before you.
				Isid.
					I am thankful, father, for 
					Your blessing.
				Isab.
					Thanks, Gheraldi; but you came 
					In haste, Sir: how was this? Have any news 
					Reached our so quiet place?
				Hyp.
					I do not like the book you gave me, father.
				Isab.
					Silence!---You do not answer, father. How!
				Isid.
					Come here, Hypolito, come.
					
						Isidora and Hypolito talk apart. 
				Isab.
					In your look 
					I read a---something that I would not read. 
					The Duchess hears us not; you need not drop 
					Your eyes thus cautiously. Speak freely to me; 
					What is't?
				Gher.
					Be patient, Madam: you will need 
					Great store of patience. Guido---
				Isab.
					Ha; speak lower.---Hypolito!
				Hyp.
					Talk kindly to me.
				Isab.
					Well; 
					Kiss me, and now begone: the father has 
					Some words for me. Perhaps, dear sister, you---
				Isid.
					I was about to leave you.
				Isab.
					Do not think 
					I wish that: but some business, such as you 
					Would think but tedious, calls me hence.
				Isid.
					Farewell!
					
						Isidora and Hypolito exeunt. 
				Isab.
					Father, if I can read your mind, (and now 
					I ought to read it,) you have news will call 
					My spirit into action:---Is it so? 
					Well! I can act. How I can think, you know. 
					How I will give my cunning force, and weave 
					The subtle threads of many a project 'round 
					My victim's brain, thou---thou shalt see.
				Gher.
					I have 
					Not told my news.
				Isab.
					I see it 'ere you speak. 
					It is of Guido: he has then discovered?---
				Gher.
					Not so.
				Isab.
					Then all is well.
				Gher.
					Why, still not so. 
					He has not yet discovered---
				Isab.
					Father, speak. 
					Am I to guess and guess and still mistake, 
					While you, with all the tidings on your tongue, 
					Keep all from me! What you know, boldly speak.
				Gher.
					Lord Guido, then, is well: that is some news; 
					For when we last heard of him, he lay sick 
					Upon his bed at Naples.
				Isab.
					Yes,---go on.
				Gher.
					He knows not of his father's marriage yet: 
					But being impatient at the silence which 
					His Isidora, and his father kept, 
					He left the South (forgetting smaller ills) 
					And comes straight to Mirandola!
				Isab.
					Indeed! 
					He must be stopped.
				Gher.
					He should have been, had I 
					Known of his coming; but he is here already.
				Isab.
					What! not arrived?
				Gher.
					In two hours hence he'll stand 
					Before his father.
				Isab.
					Has the Duke yet learned 
					His coming.
				Gher.
					No: I've kept the secret; but 
					It must be known, and quickly.
				Isab.
					And those letters--- 
					Those letters of the Duke; they never reached 
					Guido at Naples---of this you are sure!
				Gher.
					Never; nor those he wrote unto the Duke, 
					Except that one first telling that he lived; 
					(Dead Gaspero was an honest knave to us---) 
					I hold them safe: for in them lies my life.
				Isab.
					Why then go bravely to the Duke; 
					And tell him Guido comes: tell him, at once, 
					That all the bright tears Isidora shed, 
					Dropped for his son.
				Gher.
					Ha! butIcautioned her
					(Because the Duke was jealous) when she heard 
					That he still lived and loved her, to conceal 
					The name of Guido.---How shall this be answered?
				Isab.
					Who can betray? Why did she marry him?
				Gher.
					Nay,---'twas her mother's want---
				Isab.
					Well, well: now go 
					Unto the Duke (I know his humour well) 
					And tell this. Of his marriage you can say---
				Gher.
					What?
				Isab.
					You can hint that haply Guido may 
					Clothe him in ignorance,---perhaps pretend 
					He wrote to say he lived, and so forth: ha? 
					Tell him of Guido's friendship for those men--- 
					Those men who did rebel: and you can shew 
					How good a casuist you are, father, when 
					A doubt springs up; and you can pour a balm 
					(You have both sting and honey, like the bee,) 
					If there be need, and---pshaw! I school my master.
				Gher.
					You flatter, gracious lady: you are still 
					A keen displomatist: you surely cannot 
					Need my poor service.
				Isab.
					What is this?---Gheraldi! 
					What is it you ask?
				Gher.
					Nothing: no, tho' you said---
				Isab.
					I say so still: my interest at Rome 
					Is great as ever. You shall have, be sure, 
					The Cardinal's hat, when old Galotti dies.
				Gher.
					Have I your word for this?
				Isab.
					Sir, be content; 
					I give my honourable word.
				Gher.
					Enough.
				Isab.
					And now farewell. Be careful, Sir; 
					Ay, and successful, and the conclave shall 
					Have its most subtle spirit to boast of yet.
					Exit.
				Gher.
					Dear lady, fare you well.---Now for the Duke. 
					He is as shifting as the April wind: 
					And how to break this news I know not. Guido 
					By this has got my letter, and knows that 
					His love is here; no more. And now---and now, 
					Shall I go on? Pshaw! rather shall I doubt? 
					Do I not see those earthly gods mine own, 
					Power, wealth, high reputation, (holy cheat!) 
					Like dazzling sun-beams on my stricken eye 
					They blind, yet lead me onwards. I shall be 
					A Cardinal: Aye, Pope perhaps. What more 
					Need I to teach me wisdom? Now for the Duke.
				Exit.
			SCENE III.
				The Duke's private chamber.
				
					Duke and Isidora discovered---the
						Duke writing. 
				
					Curio waiting. 
				Duke.
					Here; send this pacquet, my good Curio, 
					Unto our brother Mantua: this dispatch 
					Unto Modena. You have nothing else 
					To speak of?
				Curio.
					Nothing, gracious Sir.
				Duke.
					Farewell. 
					Yet stay, if---no, 'twas nothing: fare you well. 
					
						Curio exit. 
					Forgive me that I thus neglect you, love. 
					---Why, my dear Isidora, yesterday 
					Has worn you to a shadow.
				Isid.
					Oh! not so.
				Duke.
					In faith it has.---Dear girl, I know you hate 
					These empty pageantries. Jove! so do I. 
					I'd rather be in battle, and weighed down 
					By steel and iron than by these idle gauds. 
					But we must play our part, my sweet one, in 
					This silly world. Could I order things here, 
					Half of the moon I'd waste in war: the rest 
					I'd give to Cupid.
				Isid.
					So: not all to love then?
				Duke.
					Why, no---yet I am wrong; for Oh! with you 
					Who could desert the chamber for the camp? 
					Not I. I would be with you ever---ever.
				Isid.
					That were too long.
				Duke.
					Too long, my Isidora?
				Isid.
					Ay: 'Ever' is a long time, my dear lord: 
					Love has no such eternity.
				Duke.
					Indeed!
				Isid.
					Indeed, 'tis so. Life even has its end; 
					And love cannot be longer sure than life.
				Duke.
					It is: or else 'tis nothing.---Did I think 
					That in the narrow limit of this world 
					Sweet love were bound---
					Did
					I fear that beyond These earthy barriers (which our winged
						thoughts 
					Still strive to over-fly, and still in vain,) 
					Love were no resident, I would---but you--- 
					You are a traitor to the rose crown'd God. 
					I'll kiss you in revenge.
				Isid.
					You should not punish 
					One who is ignorant only.
				Duke.
					Punish! How! 
					Will that be punishment? I said that I 
					Would kiss you, love.
				Isid.
					I know it---in revenge.
				Duke.
					True; in revenge. Revenge is bitter sweet: 
					And in its rich completion lies as well 
					Gall as oblivious balm: a paradox 
					Of passion is revenge. 'Tween you and me, 
					Fair Isidora, let it never live.
				Isid.
					I hope not, Sir.
				Duke.
					It shall not. Mark! I speak 
					More boldly here than you. I know my heart: 
					And your's too can I read.
				Isid.
					What! read my heart?
				Duke.
					I spoke in jest: you tremble: I am calm 
					(You see't) as conscious love---or fate---or death.
				Isid.
					I'm often thus: pray take no heed of it. 
					You trembled too, I thought.
				Duke.
					Feel that I do not.
					Puts out his hand.
				Isid.
					I did not note your hand, but thro' your voice 
					There ran a tremulous chord which made me---think.
				Duke.
					Of what?
				Isid.
					That you were angry: nothing more.
				Duke.
					Oh! then you far mistake me. I am not 
					A leaf blown to and fro' by every breath: 
					I am as stedfast as the oak;---ay, more, 
					As little to be shook or turned aside
					From my vowed purpose as the based rock, 
					Which when the blasts of thundering winter tear 
					The pines away from their strong rifted holds, 
					Looks calmly as tho' 'twere sun-shine still,---and smiles.
				Isid.
					I am glad you are so calm.
				Duke.
					Why are you glad---why glad 
					My Isidora? You can ne'er have cause 
					To dread my anger?
				Isid.
					Oh! I hope not.
				Duke.
					You 
					Could never dread me, Isidora?
				Isid.
					Never. 
					For never could I do you wrong, my lord.
				Duke.
					My own sweet love! Oh! my dear peerless wife! 
					By the blue sky and all its crowding stars 
					I love you better---Oh! far better than 
					Woman was ever loved. There's not an hour 
					Of day or dreaming night but I am with thee: 
					There's not a wind but whispers of thy name, 
					And not a flower that sleeps beneath the moon 
					But in its hues or fragrance tells a tale 
					Of thee, my love, to thy Mirandola. 
					Speak, dearest Isidora, can you love 
					As I do? Can---but no, no; I shall grow 
					Foolish if thus I talk. You must be gone 
					You must be gone, fair Isidora, else 
					The business of the Dukedom soon will cease. 
					I speak the truth, by Dian. Even now 
					Gheraldi waits without (or should) to see me 
					In faith, you must go: one kiss, and so, away.
				Isid.
					Farewell, my lord.
				Duke.
					We'll ride together, dearest, 
					Some few hours hence.
				Isid.
					Just as you please; farewell!
					Exit.
				Duke.
					Farewell! With what a waving air she goes 
					Along the corridor. How like a fawn; 
					Yet statelier.---Hark! no sound however soft 
					(Nor gentlest echo) telleth when she treads; 
					But every motion of her shape doth seem 
					Hallowed by silence. Thus did Hebe grow 
					Amidst the Gods, a paragon; and thus--- 
					Away! I'm grown the very fool of love.
				
					Curio enters. 
				Curio.
					The father---
				Duke.
					Bid him come. 
					
						Curio exit. 
					I never saw 
					My beauty look so well:
					the summer light
					Becomes her, tho' she shames it, being so fair. 
					Methinks I've cast full twenty years aside, 
					And am again a boy. Every breath 
					Of air that trembles thro' the window bears 
					Unusual odour. 
				
					Gheraldi enters. 
				Welcome, father, welcome: 
				If you have any good to ask, be quick, 
				For I am bountiful to-day. The tide 
				Of my free humour cannot last---nor ought, 
				Else should I soon be beggar'd. What's i'the air?--- 
				Some subtle spirit runs thro' all my veins. 
				Hope seems to ride this morning on the wind, 
				And joy outshines the sun. Why, what is this?
				Gher.
					My gracious lord!
				Duke.
					Speak out. Your tone is cold 
					As the ringing sound a footstep strikes from out 
					The frosted earth. I am like spring, rejoicing. 
					Father, I hate these mournful moods: I hate 'em. 
					Be joyful, Sir, or look so.
				Gher.
					My dear lord, 
					I have some news, which while this spirit lasts, 
					I almost fear to tell. 'Twill strike cold on 
					Your mind, my lord; but---but it must be told. 
					Your son, my lord,---
				Duke.
					How! well; go on.
				Gher.
					Lord Guido will be here, my lord, within 
					An hour.
				Duke.
					Again, Sir,---speak again.
				Gher.
					Your son, 
					Lord Guido will be here within this hour.
				Duke.
					I'm glad to hear it. 
					He uses little ceremony: well! 
					How learned you this?
				Gher.
					His courier has arrived, 
					Who left him scarce two hours ago: he then 
					Was coming hither strait.
				Duke.
					Has he not written?
				Gher.
					He has not; but---(and this indeed seems strange,) 
					His servant says---tho' this must be surmise--- 
					That his young master still is ignorant of 
					Your highness' marriage.
				Duke.
					That's impossible! 
					I wrote to him twice---more.
				Gher.
					Yes, Sir; but---
				Duke.
					But what? 
					Speak!
				Gher.
					Did your highness ever hear the name 
					O'the friend the Duchess mourned so?
				Duke.
					Never: she 
					Wished not to tell it; so, altho' my mind 
					Dislikes such secrets, I have never asked.
				Gher.
					Lord Guido then never confided his--- 
					Attachment to you?
				Duke.
					His---his? Never.
				Gher.
					Never?
				Duke.
					Never. I feel a faintness o'er me. Never. 
					Did he---did he---
				Gher.
					Another time, my lord, 
					Let's speak of this. As to your son's return---
				Duke.
					Monk! I must have your answer.
				Gher.
					Well: I have heard 
					My lord, that he---
				Duke.
					I listen: go on.
				Gher.
					That he 
					Once loved the Duchess.
				Duke.
					How! great Heaven! am I 
					Awake?
				Gher.
					I would not have disclosed this tale 
					To your Highness, but---
				Duke.
					Be silent. Can it be 
					That he (I know not what I say) has been 
					Deceived?
				Gher.
					Your Highness wrote to him before 
					Your marriage?---No.
				Duke.
					No; not befor't: we thought 
					That he was dead; yet when the news (glad news 
					I thought it,) came that still he lived, I sent 
					Direct to Naples.
				Gher
					True; by Gaspero.
				
				Duke.
					But wherefore,---nay, how was't you dared conceal 
					From me that he had loved her? Speak to that
				Gher.
					I thought it a boyish fancy, soon to change. 
					Yet that he loved her once, (madly) I can 
					Avouch.
				Duke.
					He is not apt to change.
				Gher.
					Why that--- 
					When first I knew he had not written home, 
					Struck on my mind. I own it.
				
				Duke.aside. ---Upon mine 
					It falls as cold as winter. You should not 
					Have kept it from me. 'Twas a fault.
				Gher.
					Nay, Sir,---
				Duke.
					O Heaven! had I but known for whom those tears 
					Were shed:---butstillshe weeps: Ah! wherefore still?
					He is alive.
				Gher.
					My lord!
				Duke.
					Perhaps he comes 
					Here to reproach or make a shew of grief: 
					Perhaps---Did you not speak?
				Gher.
					Yes, Sir; your son---
				Duke.
					Did I not watch him thro' his headstrong youth, 
					This fault forgiving and forgetting that--- 
					His friendship with that false Vitelli, whom 
					I hate as I hate shame---his strange request 
					For those three rebels (that was never cleared) 
					Marni, Saletto, Rossi? you know this.
				Gher.
					If I might but advise---
				Duke.
					Be dumb, Sir. I 
					Can be my own good counsel. Did I not 
					Write, and so kindly too?
					Did---did he come
					Quite straight from Naples?
				Gher.
					Yes, my lord; I hear 
					He only staid at Count Vitelli's house; 
					And there not long.
				Duke.
					At Count Vitelli's? He 
					Can never pass that traitor's den. What spell 
					Doth drag him there?
				Gher.
					None that I know of, Sir, 
					But, may I now advise? If aught be wrong 
					Touching Vitelli's friendship with your son. 
					(Tho' I hope nothingiswrong) or---or if
					He loves the lady Isidora still,---
				Duke.
					Death! thou false monk!---Sir, if your tongue but utter 
					A word of that---What! love her? love!
				Gher.
					I meant---
				Duke.
					You said he loved.
				Gher.
					Did I? pray pardon me. 
					This news has ruffled me, my lord. I beg 
					That you'll forget. My mouth is filled to-day 
					With errors.
				Duke.
					Yet should heindeedlove her?
				Gher.
					If then, my lord, your son should but pretend 
					To love, and urge you to injustice---
				Duke.
					Ha! 
					That's well---well thought of. Oh! there's many a knave 
					About me (that I feel) too ready still 
					To second old Vitelli's bloody hand. 
				Can he be foe to me? I will not think it. Yet I'll be calm, and
					wary.
				Gher.
					Some one comes.
					
						Carlo enters. 
				Carlo.
					Your Highness!
				Duke.
					Speak!
				Carlo.
					Lord Guido will be here 
					Almost---
				Duke.
					Go to him, good Gheraldi. Leave us. 
					
						Carlo exit. 
					Receive him, father, and before he comes 
					To me, inform him (mark if honestly 
					He take the news,) that I am married.---When 
					You have told this, say that I wish his presence: 
					Yet, first announce him; so I may learn how far 
					His soul is bent to cunning.
				Gher.
					I am gone.
				Duke.
					Take good note, Sir.
				Gher.
					I will.
				Duke.
					Be sure you do!
				Exeunt separately.
			
		
		ACT II.
			SCENE I.
				A Court-yard before the Palace.
				Gheraldi.
				Gher.
					He must not see the Duchess yet. These scenes 
					Of tears and quarrel but ill suit a court; 
					And the Duke loves decorum.---Now have I 
					Been confidant to father, and to son,--- 
					To her (by virtue of my calling)---her,
					And the proud Isabella. Had I not 
					A cowl, I fear a blush at times might tell 
					A story. Guido knows his love is here; 
					(Thus much I've written to him,) but that she 
					Is Duchess here, he knows not: so,---he comes.
				
				Guido.
					without.
					Ha! ha!---well, as you please: I shall expect you.
				
					Guido enters, and is passing over in haste. 
				Gher.
					My lord! lord Guido!
				Guido.
					Ha! Gheraldi, you? 
					Where's Isidora? Is my father well?
				Gher.
					Your father bids---
				Guido.
					I'll see him presently: 
					But where's my love?
				Gher.
					He has commanded me---
				Guido.
					Not now, not now. 
					Where is she?
				Gher.
					First, hear the Duke's message; nay.
				Guido.
					Now by my soul, I shall be angry with you. 
					Say to your lord some ten,---five minutes hence, 
					I'll seek him in his study. You oppress me. 
					What do you mean that thus you shake your head 
					In silence---or is't sorrow?---Ha! she's dead?
				Gher.
					Not so, my lord.
				Guido.
					Why all is well then;---yet, 
					(What do you mean?) you seem to mock my joy, 
					And lay a leaden hand upon the wings 
					Of all my hopes.---Oh! Isidora, where, 
					Where areyouloitering now when Guido's here?
					By the bright god of love, I'll punish you, 
					Idler, and press your rich red lips until 
					The colour flies.
				Gher.
					My lord: nay, do not frown. 
					I have a story of deep interest, Sir. 
					It is my duty (my sad duty now,) 
					To break unto your ear some tidings.
				Guido.
					Quick!
				Gher.
					Your father, my dear lord, is married.
				Guido.
					So.---
				Gher.
					Reasons of state---
				Guido.
					Keep 'em, good Monk, I have no stomach now 
					For any food but love.
				Gher.
					Strong reasons did induce my lord ('twas when 
					You were reported dead) to seek a bride. 
					He left the common course that monarchs use, 
					And chose from out the land he govern'd, one 
					Who might have shamed the world.
				Guido.
					That was not well, 
					At least.
				Gher.
					I mean she was so fair, my lord.
				Guido.
					I mark you. Well?
				Gher.
					My lord your father (urged 
					By some state policy, and fearful lest 
					Your death should snap the link your friendship formed 
					'Tween him, and Count Navarro,)---
				Guido.
					Chose his daughter?
				Gher.
					No; not---not thus.
				Guido.
					How then? Speak! Is my heart 
					Bursting? What is't I fear? My very soul 
					Is sick, and full of some dismay, as tho' 
					Fate were upon me. If---I dare not ask: 
					I dare not, tho' a word would end it all. 
					Gheraldi! no, no, no: silence awhile: 
					I will not hear thee now. Oh! heaven and earth! 
					If it were so---it cannot be: it shall not. 
					Yet if it were---Oh! Isidora, you, 
					Whatyou---She is as constant as the stars
					That never vary, and more chaste than they. 
					Forgive, forgive me that I slander thee 
					Even in dreams. Gheraldi, now I'll listen, 
					And you shall tell your tale. I was a fool 
					Just now. Forgive me, father:---now.
				Gher.
					I said your father did desire a bride 
					From out his realm. Navarro's daughter then 
					Was woo'd; now she is married: but he had 
					Two nieces.
				Guido.
					Ay, I see't. My father saw 
					The lady Julia: yes, I see how 'twas; 
					It was so, was it not?
				Gher.
					He saw her there.
				Guido.
					Ay, ay: she was a pretty girl when last 
					I was at home: and so he married her?
				Gher.
					He saw them both, Sir, with a favouring eye. 
					The lady Isidora then in tears---
				Guido.
					True; they might not become her: yet she's fair. 
					When joy is in her eye 'tis like the light 
					Of Heaven: blue, deep and ethereal blue. 
					I would not wish a life more beautiful; 
					And, were she but a Saint, I'd worship her. 
					Sad Isidora! Did thine eyes indeed 
					Shower diamond drops for me? My gentle love! 
					But Guido (thine) is come at last to kiss
					The tears away for ever. Happiness 
					Looks out to find thee; shall it look in vain!
				Gher.
					May I proceed, my lord?
				Guido.
					I had forgot. 
					Where were we?
				Gher.
					I was telling that your father 
					Saw Count Navarro's nieces, and preferr'd 
					The elder.
				Guido.
					You---you said hemarried Julia.
				Gher.
					No, my lord: no.
				Guido.
					Whom then? it cannot be.
				Gher.
					My lord! I---
				Guido.
					Monk! speak out: Curse on my trembling. 
					One word---a single word. Now:---tho' your breath 
					Carry damnation (as I think it does) 
					To every hope of mine, be quick, quick.---Now. 
					Stun me with sorrow, lest I feel too much, 
					And slay thee. What's her name---my father's bride?
				Gher.
					'Tis Isidora.
				Guido.
					Thou has done't.
				Gher.
					My lord! 
					Look up, my Lord! So---there: you're very pale. 
					Nay, for your father's sake.
				Guido.
					Ha! ha! ha! ha!
				Gher.
					Lord Guido! I---Gheraldi---speak to you. 
					Oh! well: I see you know me now. Not so. 
					Nay, look more cheerfully.---You're better now?
				Guido.
					Thou---thou knew'st all my love. Thou busy priest---
				Gher.
					My lord.
				Guido.
					Thou pander to my father's wish, 
					(He is no father, I disown him.) Thou--- 
					Thou busy meddling Monk.
				Gher.
					My lord, my lord, 
					This is not well!
				Guido.
					Away! my mother? Oh!mymother was
					As pure as purity. I will not talk 
					Of her whois---yet oh! what pity 'tis
					That one so fair should now be full of blots, 
					And that a face which love had breathed upon 
					Should now be scarred all over. Once, I thought 
					That in her eyes, (how beautiful they were!) 
					Her soul shone out.
				Gher.
					If you will let me speak---
				Guido.
					But she is grown a harlot in my sight. 
					What! married to my father, tomyfather!
					What! smile upon the son, and wed the sire, 
					Because---there's some strange cause. What blinding spell 
					Is there now hung between us and the Moon, 
					That dims the sights of women? There's a cause: 
					I dare not guess: I will not.
				Gher.
					May I speak?
				Guido.
					Father Gheraldi, you have done your errand. 
					Tell the Duke of Mirandola, his Son 
					Is now at ease.---Say that the news at first 
					Was somewhat stirring: but that he---ay, he 
					Forgives---forgets; no, never, never can 
					That soon forgot that all his life was blighted. 
					Say what you will, Sir.
				Gher.
					But your father, now, 
					Expects you.
				Guido.
					I'm too gallant, Sir; so tell him. 
					I'll pay my duty to the Duchess first; 
					Unto my---mother, since it must be so: 
					And when we have discuss'd some words, why then 
					I'll meet him. No more words, Sir.---Now, farewell!
				Exeunt at different sides.
			SCENE II.
				A Hall in the Palace.
				 Enter Isabella , meeting Casti and
						Julio . 
				Isab.
					Welcome unto Mirandola.
				Casti.
					Many thanks.
				Isab.
					Ah! Signior Julio! give you welcome, Sir.
				Julio.
					I thank you, Madam, thank you heartily.
					A little leisure is welcome even to me.
				Isab.
					You have not lost your spirits in the wars?
				Julio.
					No Madam, much the same; I'm still, at least, 
					Your servant ever.
				Isab.
					Oh! Sir, we shall try 
					Your gallantry to-day: the Duke hath ordered 
					A feast in honour of his son.---Count Casti, 
					You've seen my brother?
				Casti.
					Madam?
				Isab.
					You are wrapt 
					In study, Sir: some fosse, or counterscarp, 
					Or siege, or ambuscade then filled your brain.
				Casti.
					No, Madam, none.
				Isab.
					Brief answer.---Have you seen 
					My brother yet?
				Casti.
					I have not.
				Isab.
					He will be 
					Rejoiced to see you. Ah!---yes, it is he.
				Julio.
					Faith, 'tis the Duke: he looks more young than ever.
				Casti.
					Now, to my mind, his eye is filled with care.
				
					Duke enters. 
				Duke.
					Ha! gentlemen, and friends, I'm glad to see 
					Such faces at Mirandola.
				Casti.
					My lord, 
					We are your son's companions.
				Duke.
					So I hear: 
					Therefore, ye are more welcome, Signior,
					To Julio .] 
					Have heard of your good acts. Your sword is dulled 
					With carnage, I am told. Fair faces here 
					Have smiled, and gentle hearts have wished you well.
				Julio.
					My Lord!
				Duke.
					Indeed I hear 'twas so.
				Isab.
					'Tis true.
				Duke.
					Signior, your deeds have filled the mouth of fame, 
					And you too have admirers; none more true 
					Than I.
					Takes Casti's hand. 
				Casti.
					My lord, you do me honour.
				Duke.
					Sir, 
					I do myself much honour thus to take 
					A good man by the hand. You are not all 
					Soldier, and yet enough: I do not love 
					All courtier: I myself, you know, was once 
					Something (not much) o'the soldier.
				Julio.
					Oh!---
				Casti.
					My lord, 
					You have fought bravely; that the world well knows.
				Julio.
					Your foes especially, my lord.
				Duke.
					Oh! no. 
					I drew the sword for pastime: you for right. 
					Shall I not see my son?
				Isab.
					He will be here 
					Speedily.
				Julio.
					If I am right, I saw him talk 
					Just now with the confessor, old Gheraldi. 
					I'll bid him come to you.
				Duke.
					Not so: stay, Sir. 
					I'll wait for my son's leisure. He is tired 
					Perhaps, and his too sensitive nature asks 
					Some quiet 'ere he sees me.---You have been 
					With him throughout the war, Sir, have you not?
				Casti.
					I have, my lord.
				Duke.
					I mean, attached to the same 
					Battalion?
				Casti.
					'Twas so.
				Duke.
					Was he sad, or gay?
				Casti.
					He has a natural gaiety that sits 
					Pleasantly on him, when no ill's at hand: 
					But he is soon depressed and latterly---
				Duke.
					Well latterly---you stop?
					
						Isabella draws Julio aside. 
				Casti.
					Of late, 
					He has been ill, (wounded you know,) and grief--- 
					Some secret sorrow wearing down his heart, 
					Has paled his cheek, and thinned it: and at times, 
					I've seen him fretted much beyond his custom.
				Duke.
					Indeed! then must it be 
					The sun, (there is no cause beside,)---the Sun 
					Hath burnt these humours on him, and perhaps 
					Quickened the wholesome current of his blood, 
					'Till it outruns it's channels:
					then, you know,
					Come fevers, and in the abused brain 
					Distraction; so, before the sight diseased 
					Shadows will stalk, and ghosts of unreal ills: 
					Filling the bloated fancy 'till it bursts: 
					These things I know.---But Guido---?
				Casti.
					Oh! he will 
					Grow fresh again, now that his father's arms 
					Are open.
				Julio.
					And his love's.
				Duke.
					True, Signior,---as you say, 
					I see Gheraldi---True; my arms are open. 
					Excuse me, Signior Casti; I shall soon 
					See you again. Once more I bid you welcome. 
					You will not fail my banquet.
				Casti.
					We are much 
					Honored, my lord.
				Julio.
					My lord, we---
				Isab.
					Come, Signior, you'll go with us; 
					I have some things to say.
				Duke.
					Why doth the Friar loiter? Sirs, farewell!
				Julio.
					We take our leave, my lord.
					Exeunt Isabella, Julio , and Casti .
					
				Duke.
					He motions and retires.---Well, for the present 
					I must shake hands with patience, and be still. 
					The day is lowering. What a beaming morn
					It was; (ay, so was mine,) and now the clouds 
					Hang round about like some fierce accident 
					Which comes upon us as we think to reach 
					Safely our home.---Now, should this boy have been 
					Cheated---it cannot be; old Gaspero 
					When he returned to die, gave fair account 
					Of the delivery of my letters.---When 
					I see him I will look into his soul: 
					And yet whene'er I see him 
					(True son of dead Bianca,) her pale smile 
					And scornful eye shoot thro' my very heart. 
					I would that I could think he meant me fair; 
					Why should I think him guilty---is he not 
					My son? Ah! did I mean his Mother fair? 
					And yet my will has made him now my heir? 
					Passing my Sister's son.---Can he still love her? 
					Ha! the Monk passes. So, now for the news.
				Exit.
			SCENE III.
				An Apartment of the Duchess.
				
					Isidora enters. 
				Isid.
					He comes, he comes; and I must see him, too. 
					Oh! that I must.---Not yet.---I must, Imust.
					Hark! no, it is not he: It is my heart. 
					Will it not burst? My throat is full and choaking. 
					God! look upon me now, and save me!---Save! 
					He'll come and curse me---and it will be good; 
					For I have stolen his heart away, and flung 
					Mine own to ruin.---Ruin! Oh! that I 
					Could tell him all about my cruel lot, 
					And how I was betrayed, and lost for ever. 
					That Monk advised me---Oh! no more of that. 
					Ha! some one comes.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.after a pause. Madam, I come to
						pay 
					My duty to you.
				Isid.
					Welcome; you are welcome.
				Guido.
					I come to see how well her bridal dress 
					Becomes the Duchess of Mirandola.
				Isid.
					You have been well, I hope?
				Guido.
					Since when?
				Isid.
					Since you--- 
					You and I parted.
				Guido.
					That's a long time, now. 
					I have forgot: how is't thatyouremember?
				Isid.
					I---I---Oh! pity me.
				Guido.
					Weep, lady, weep. 
					Tears (yet they're bitter) purify the soul, 
					But your's is fair?---I know they ease the heart. 
					Mother!
				Isid.
					Oh! Guido,---cruel, cruel, cruel!
				
				Guido.
					aside.
					By Heaven, my courage begins to fail; and I 
					Grow womanish. Now let me wring her heart, 
					As she wrung mine.---Ah! there she weeps away 
					Almost to dissolution. How she bends, 
					Like one who sickens with remorse or love; 
					And she, perhaps, has been betrayed.---Alas! 
					Poor Isidora!
				Isid.
					Ah!---you spoke?---you spoke?
				Guido.
					'Twas nothing.
				Isid.
					Nothing? It was all to me. 
					'Twas happiness---no, that is gone: 'twas Hope: 
					'Twas pardon. Oh! my lord, (Guido no more,) 
					What have I done that youcanuse me thus?
					I would not for the world, for all the world, 
					Put you to such great sorrow.
				Guido.
					Shall I tell you?
				Isid.
					Yes.
				Guido.
					Listen to me, then. When you were young--- 
					You are young still, and fair; the more's the pity: 
					But in the time I speak of, you were just 
					Bursting from childhood---with a face as fair 
					As tho' you had look'd in Paradise, and caught 
					It's early beauty: then, your smile was soft, 
					As Innocence before it learns to love. 
					And yet a woman's passion dwelt within 
					Your heart, as warm as Love.---But I am wrong?
				Isid.
					Oh! no. I loved---
				Guido.
					Indeed?
				Isid.
					Indeed, indeed.
				Guido.
					Well!---There was one who loved you too. He said 
					That every hope he had rested on you. 
					He worshipped you, as Idols are adored 
					In countries near the sun. He gave his heart 
					So absolutely up, that had he thought 
					Then, that you would desert him, he'd have slain 
					Himself before you. You were his home, his heaven, 
					His wealth, his light, his mind, and life substantial. 
					But then he went away to the fierce wars, 
					(His honor was pledged for it,) and he left 
					You with an oath upon your soul behind. 
					'Twas said he died---
				Isid.
					One said he saw you fall.
				Guido.
					'Twas said he died, and that she grieved awhile, 
					In virgin widowhood for him. At last, 
					A Duke---a reigning Duke, with wintry hair, 
					And subtle spirit, and---without a heart, 
					Came wooing to her, and so---you do not heed me--- 
					And so she dried her tears, and (tho' the youth 
					Wrote that he lived,) she laugh'd, and left the son, 
					To marry with the father.
				Isid.
					And you wrote 
					To me?
				Guido.
					To you, and him.
				Isid.
					I feared 'twas so. 
					Now Heaven help me; for I'm wound about
					By their strong toils, and there is no escaping. 
					Oh! I am worn, and broken down by grief. 
					I dare not hope that you'll believe me, yet 
					That letter, Guido---Oh, I never knew it; 
					I had no letter---saw no letter.
				Guido.
					What! 
					I wrote to you from Naples: from my bed 
					Where I lay languishing, by Gaspero, 
					My father's servant. Why, I wrote---(has there 
					Been cozening here!)---unto my father:
					he
					Will not deny't. Where is that slave?
				Isid.
					Gaspero? He is dead.
				Guido.
					He was my father's servant. Could he be 
					Unfaithful? No.
				Isid.
					Your father prized him much. 
					Oh! it is too clear: we are both undone.
				Guido.
					It may be;---nay, it is. But, 'ere I sink, 
					I will be righted some way, or revenged. 
					What! does he think to cheat me now, and wear 
					His prize abroad so boldly.---beforeme?
					I'll have revenge.
				Isid.
					He is your father, Guido. 
					Nay---
				Guido.
					I disown him. He has lost his son. 
					Some parents shut their children from their homes, 
					(Young boys and gentle girls) butIabjure
					My father in his age: let him go down 
					Into his grave alone.
				Isid.
					Do not incense him.
				Guido.
					Whom?
				Isid.
					The Duke.
				Guido.
					You're right. 
					Call him no more my father. No; I'll talk 
					As one man with his equal; or, perhaps, 
					I may wear something of superior scorn, 
					And drop a word or two of charity; 
					But that will be for thy sake, my poor girl! 
					Nay, dry your tears: and let us part awhile.
				Isid.
					Farewell.
				Guido.
					Oh! not farewell yet. I but go 
					To see the Duke. When shall we meet again?
				Isid.
					We must not; yet---
				Guido.
					We will, we will, once more.
				Isid.
					Hark!---hush! your father comes.
				Guido.
					Why, that is well. 
					We will (I'm glad of't) say at once good morrow, 
					Without more ceremony.
				Isid.
					No; not now, 
					Not now, I cannot bear it.---Nay, for me.
				Guido.
					That is a charm I cannot disobey.
				Isid.
					Quick, quick, he comes!
				Guido.
					We'll meet again. Remember! 
					
						Isid. exit. 
					
						Curio enters. 
					Well, Sir?
				Curio.
					My lord; his highness waits for you.
				Guido.
					Where is he?
				Curio.
					In his private chamber, Sir.
				Guido.
					Tell him, I come. 
					
						Curio exit. 
					Now, thou false Fortune, am I still thy fool? 
					Shall I see him, and, like a cheated child, 
					Believe each word he utters?---He was kind 
					Once, amidst all his pride, to me: but now 
					He has (has he not?)---robbed me---stolen away 
					The gem I love beyond the whole vast world, 
					And with a selfish vanity, here, before 
					My very eyes, he wears it to my shame--- 
					
						Hisshame, and my deep sorrow. Now, my heart,
					I have known thee firm in danger, droop not now!
				Exit.
			
		
		ACT III.
			SCENE I.
				 (The Duke pacing up and down his room---at last he stops.) 
				Duke.
					Hark! He stays long---but Isidora is 
					Prudent, I think,---I hope. His blood is quick, 
					But I will not doubt. Why should he loiter at 
					Vitelli's house,---that traitor's?---He stays long, 
					---A month ago and I was happy! No; 
					Not happy, yet encircled by deep joy, 
					Which tho' 'twas all around, I could not touch. 
					But it was ever thus with Happiness: 
					It is the gay to-morrow of the mind 
					That never comes.---Hark! no! 'twas but a door 
					That shut. And is my soul in such dismay, 
					That every petty whisper of the wind 
					Can scare me? Once---but that is passed, and now 
					Each sound is laden and each shadow filled 
					With fears: like exhalations in the dusk 
					They rise before me, wheresoe'er I tread. 
					Who's there?
				
					Curio enters. 
				Curio.
					Lord Guido 
					Is now without, my lord.
				Duke.
					Bid him come in. 
					
						Curio exit. 
					There is a strange confusion in my mind: 
					Perhaps my son, like a fair morning light, 
					May dispel all. He is here:---how pale he looks.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.
					I am come, my lord.
				Duke.
					I,---I rejoice to see you. I am proud 
					To know my son has won so good a name. 
					Your honours will shame mine. Well, well, so be it. 
					On you has fallen now the task to lift 
					The fair and great name of Mirandola. 
					You have been absent long: too long.
				Guido.
					My lord!
				Duke.
					I am your father, Guido,
				Guido.
					Oh! much more: 
					You are the Prince.
				Duke.
					But still your father: nay---
				Guido.
					My lord, there are some things which, little used, 
					Soon rust: such is respect. The name of Prince 
					Brings to the memory of many men 
					What they might else forget.
				Duke.
					There is no cause 
					For this between us.
				Guido.
					Pardon me: for once 
					Give me my humour.
				Duke.
					As you please,---for once. 
					Come let us sit. What cause have you for this?
				Guido.
					Cause! but---but let it pass.
				Duke.
					Dear Guido.
				Guido.
					Sir!
				Duke.
					I do not understand---
				Guido.
					And yet it is 
					As plain as day---as the full risen day. 
					But let us sit: with all my heart.
					
						Duke sits. 
				Duke.
					I am 
					Distressed, my son, to hear---
				Guido.
					Ha! have you heard?
				Duke.
					I hear the words you speak.
				Guido.
					But understand not. 
					Was it not so, my lord? You hear---
				Duke.
					I hear, 
					And see, and feel that now my only son, 
					And the first subject of my Dukedom, dares 
					To spurn his Prince,---his father; putting off 
					The garb of love, and---
				Guido.
					Right: it is a cloak; 
					Under whose folds, fathers as well as sons, 
					Do things to shame the stars.
				Duke.
					Guido, by Heaven!--- 
					But this---this is not well, my son, no more of it. 
					I sent for you by the Confessor---
				Guido.
					Ay, 
					That you may in my ear unload your mind 
					Of some dark secret; what is't? Speak, my Lord. 
					If you have done aught that may leave a blot 
					On the bright annals of our house, confess, 
					And I will be as secret as deceit. 
					If you have been a tyrant,
					and enslaved
					The bodies or the minds of noble men, 
					Why, let me know it: or, if you have been 
					As poisonous as the serpent, or have mined, 
					Mole-like, your way beneath your neighbour's house, 
					And shook down all his happiness, confess it: 
					Or if, like the wilderness creature, you have prey'd 
					Even upon your young, I bid you still 
					To tell me and take comfort.
				Duke.
					I have been 
					Silent, my son---
				Guido.
					Not so, not so; and yet you were in truth: 
					When slander came abroad, and I was absent, 
					You kept a politic silence; thus I've heard: 
					And, when I fell, you wept and kissed away 
					The bright warm tears from Isidora's cheek. 
					But I rose up again:---I rose, my lord, 
					Up from my bed of battle, and while the blood 
					Harden'd upon my wounds, I traced, with weak 
					And shaking fingers, a poor scrawl, reminding 
					Her of our love: you start? our love I said; 
					And you---you kept it from her. Speak? was't so? 
					There's no one to betray you: should you blush, 
					I'll hush your virtue, like a murder, up.
				Duke.
					Guido, you go too far: no more of this.
				Guido.
					No more?
				Duke.
					You'll anger me---I tell you this 
					For the last time. My blood is hot as your's.
				Guido.
					Much hotter. Noble lord, if I may speak---
				Duke.
					You may not, Sir. Death! shall I stand and suffer 
					These insolent taunts from you, my son, my slave, 
					My---
				Guido.
					Slave!
				Duke.
					Ay, Sir, whate'er may suit my humour.
				Guido.
					Your highness's humour changes, that I know.
				Duke.
					Sir, tho' it shift as often as the wind, 
					'Tis not for you to mark it. 'Tis my humour, 
					My spleen, my will.
				
					Curio enters. 
				Curio.
					Did my lord call?
				Duke.
					Begone. 
					If then another word---I said, begone. 
					
						Curio exit. 
					But no, no, no: no more of this: no more.
				Guido.
					Then, you deny---?
				Duke.
					Ah! Guido, this will bring 
					Bitter repentance, in some after day; 
					Till then be silent---still.
				Guido.
					Oh! I will be 
					As silent as the grave you've dug for me. 
					I'll be as wary as the fox, and subtle,
					But like the adder, when I'm questioned, deaf. 
					And should you fall, (Princes may fall, my lord, 
					As the red leaves in autumn,---nay in spring;) 
					If your own tyranny, or others hate, 
					Rebels at home, or cozening friends abroad, 
					Or open foes should cast you down at last,--- 
					Fear not; I will be there; close at your heart, 
					Just like the canker when the tree decays.
				Duke.
					When you have ended,---
				Guido.
					I have said,---have done.
				Duke.
					You have; and had I not 
					Some of that kindly blood, which you deny, 
					You must have spoken less. Guido, you 
					Have done me shameful wrong; but I have been 
					Patient,---as patient as my nature might: 
					I have born words; such words as never prince 
					Yet bore before from subject, or from son.
				Guido.
					Perhaps,---
				Duke.
					Speak out.
				Guido.
					Perhaps, I have been warm; 
					But, no,---no.
				Duke.
					As you please. Your humour turns 
					Quickly as mine, it seems; but it shall be 
					My humour to forget. If, after this, 
					In your distemper'd judgment---but no more. 
					---Your mother---
				Guido.
					Ah! indeed no more, no more.
				Duke.
					The Duchess of Mirandola expects 
					To see you. Come, I will go with you,---now.
				Guido.
					I---I have seen her.
				Duke.
					So: 'twas well.
				Guido.
					I bade 
					Gheraldi tells you that I had gone thither.
				Duke.
					'Tis true; he told me (I remember now,) 
					That you had gone to pay your duty there. 
					She was rejoiced to see you?
				Guido.
					No; not much.
				Duke.
					How? not rejoiced? it was not well to meet 
					My son, and not rejoice; but you must pardon. 
					She has been ill, and the full summer moon 
					Sways at will women's fancies.
				Guido.
					You are gay.
				Duke.
					Why not? I have my wife here, and my son 
					The one is beautiful, the other brave. 
					I have no curse that clings to me: no fear 
					That enemies or
					friends can do me harm.
					There's not a traitor in the realm could live 
					Now undetected.
				Guido.
					Traitors! there are none.
				Duke.
					Oh! be not sure. When first the snake puts on 
					His summer-skin, he looks not loathsome: 'tis 
					When he's contract and wrinkled, we begin 
					To fear or hate him.---But these things are not 
					Fit for a day like this. We should be gay.
				Guido.
					I'll do my best.
				Duke.
					Who can ask more? Come then; 
					We'll speak no more of the serpent; yet it was
					The circling emblem of eternity, 
					And in its terrible folds this world and all 
					Its host of strange and proud inhabitants, 
					With proud men at the head, was compass'd once. 
					If 'twere so now, it would be well, methinks, 
					If the lithe thing would draw its sinuous shape 
					Closer and closer, till---but I forget 
					The festival.
				Guido.
					You do in truth, my lord: 
					That was a curious fancy.
				Duke.
					Heed it not: 
					I speculate at times, as well as you. 
					But you must alter. You must be gay, 
					In dress as looks. Now let us part. We'll meet 
					Presently, in the feasting room.
				Guido.
					I will 
					Be with you presently, redressed.
					Exit.
				Duke.
					Farewell. 
					Redress'd!---Now, what a querulous boy is this, 
					Cheating his spleen with words. Insolent words!--- 
					Yet he's my son,---poor, poor Bianca's son. 
					Shall I not curb my fretful nature, when 
					I think of him?---Ah! yes---I'll strive to think 
					Not ill of him.---He bears an honest shew. 
					Were this a time for questioning, I'd ask 
					Touching those letters, and Vitelli's plots--- 
					'Tis not;---perhaps to-morrow. If he should 
					Have been abused.---How much his pallid smile 
					Shone like Bianca's. Oh! I'll love him yet; 
					And he shall love me too: and yet---and yet--- 
					Ah! thus my fiery and suspicious nature 
					Preys ever on itself.---Iwillbe calm.
				Exit.
			SCENE I.
				A Chamber in the Palace.
				
					Isidora and Isabella enter. 
				Isab.
					Dear sister, had your face little more mirth 
					How much you'd grace the feast.
				Isid.
					Must I then wear 
					A mask, my lady?
				Isab.
					No: no need of that. 
					But what has troubled you?
				Isid.
					O, nothing, nothing.
				Isab.
					Nay, now you deal not fairly with my love.
				Isid.
					Well, he---Lord Guido has been with me.
				Isab.
					Yes.
				Isid.
					He's full of grief: that's all. I did not weep 
					For that.
				Isab.
					He must not shew this sorrow at the feast. 
					To-day: The Duke is quick, and apt to doubt. 
					Bid him be cautious there.
				Isid.
					We will not meet 
					Again, tho' we had purposed. Guido has 
					Told all: one word unto his old regard 
					He gave, and so we parted.
				Isab.
					This I know.
				Isid.
					You know.
				Isab.
					Ay, my sweet sister: I have seen,--- 
					Had you but seen him, too, and heard him sigh, 
					It would have moved you. When he said he had 
					Not even a token to remember you, 
					I promised---
				Isid.
					What?
				Isab.
					Be not alarmed, dear sister, 
					But I believe, I promised one: Indeed 
					Some message you should send, for if a word 
					(An idle word) escape by chance to-day--- 
					The Duke is jealous.
				Isid.
					Ah! whom can I trust?
				Isab.
					True;---all about the Duke are cunning; stay--- 
					I'll be your messenger; but you must give 
					The token for him: else he'll not believe. 
					What bauble shall it be, sister? Ha! this,--- 
					This will be excellent.
				Isid.
					Not that. If you 
					Must have some pledge, take this: that ruby ring 
					Was the Duke's gift, and 'tis a favourite.
				Isab.
					Shame! 
					He will not recognize so poor a thing 
					As this for your's. Give me your hand; in faith 
					It is a white one. Now, were I a man 
					I'd kiss it, sister, thus.
					Takes the ring.
				Isid.
					Nay, nay; return 
					That ring to me: I pray you---do return it.
				Isab.
					What shall I say to him?
				Isid.
					Give me the ring.--- 
					The ring.
				Isab.
					I'll trust then to my thoughts; and I 
					May strengthen your entreaties with my own. 
					Should he look sad on you, or smile, the Duke 
					Would madden with strange fears, believe't.
				Isid.
					Indeed, 
					I did not know that he---Hark! hark! who comes?
				Isab.
					Perhaps the Duke.
				Isid.
					Ha! then I'll leave you---nay, I must.
					Exit.
				Isab.
					Farewell. I hate her not, tho' her pale face 
					Reproaches me. Poor victim! she is in 
					My toils,---but 'tis to make my child a prince. 
					That base-born,---he has been preferr'd to mine, 
					I and my rights were trampled down---ha! now for 
					My message.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.
					Must I then put on a look, 
					And say I am content to all that is,--- 
					To all that has been? Well, 'tis forhersake;
					And what would I not do for her, tho' she--- 
					She has abandoned me. Poor girl, poor girl! 
					It is too late to grieve.
				Isab.
					What study's this? 
					Dear Guido, are you plotting?
				Guido.
					How! I am 
					As innocent---
				Isab.
					Against the Duchess and the Duke? nay, nay, I know 
					All, Sir; your meetings, and her tears. Beware 
					The Duke.
				Guido.
					My heart's as innocent---
				Isab.
					I know it, but the Duke 
					Is jealous;---that's the word: and you must not 
					Awaken him. See; do you know this ring? 
					'Tis Isidora's.
				Guido.
					Ha!
				Isab.
					She sent it to you. 
					I told her of your grief---(Nay, do not chide,) 
					And got this---it will serve, tho' love is over, 
					To bind your friendship fast.
				Guido.
					She sends me that?
				Isab.
					She sends you this, and bids you smile to-night.
				Guido.
					I'll do't: but 'twas not needful.
				Isab.
					You will do 
					This for---
				Guido.
					For friendship, Madam, and no more.
				Isab.
					Take care'o the ring. 
					Hush! here comes one who need not know it. Well!--- 
					Well, father?
				
					Gheraldi enters. 
				Gher.
					Madam, is the Duchess here?
				Isab.
					She's gone.
				Gher.
					The Duke is waiting, and the feast 
					Prepared. My lord, your friends are there already.
				Guido.
					I shall be with them, Sir.
				Isab.
					Come hither, father.
					They talk.
				Guido.
					A feast---for what? And yet 'tis always thus 
					Why do I quarrel with't? When a man dies 
					They feast and shout---and when a child is born: 
					And when a father thrusts his last pale girl 
					Into the arms of age (ah, death!) they feast, 
					Revel, and dance, and laugh, and mock the night 
					(The modest ear of night) with riot!---Oh! 
					Why should I quarrel with it? I am now 
					The puppet of the day---but I forget: 
					Now for his highness' feast---I will remember.
					To Isab.
					
				
				Exit.
				Isab.
					I'll follow you.
				Gher.
					'Twas a bright star that guided you to-day?
				Isab.
					But should we not---Ha! let me think.
				Gher.
					I have 
					Been with the Duke; he thought himself at ease, 
					But with a word I started him: he tried 
					To laugh away his doubts, and I agreed 
					That they were nought; and thensupposeda case---
				Isab.
					Ha! that was well.
				Gher.
					But he sprung up 
					Sternly and bade me go: and swore he was 
					Content: and then re-echoed my own words, 
					On this I essayed again, but all his spirit 
					Burst forth, and I was ordered straight to quit him.
				Isab.
					He says he's satisfied?
				Gher.
					Madam, his tongue 
					Proclaims it; but his hand and troubled eye 
					Give fierce denial,---there's that in his heart, 
					Which some day must uproot it. But for the ring?
					Music without.
				Isab.
					Come this way, and we'll talk: the feast is ready.
				Exeunt.
			SCENE III.
				A Banquetting Room.---Nobles and Ladies assembled.
				
					Julio and Casti entering. 
				Julio.
					This is a gallant shew.
				Casti.
					Indeed a fair one: 
					And yet, 'tis but a shew.
				Julio.
					How do you mean?
				Casti.
					Oh! nothing: merely what I say, no more.
				Julio.
					In faith you puzzle me: ha! what a face 
					Look, my dear Casti. Do you see that girl 
					Whose hair is bound with pearls? her cheek is like--- 
					Pshaw!---like---like---
				Casti.
					Like a young rose opening slowly, 
					Kissed by the breath of May.
				Julio.
					I love a rose.
				Casti.
					Sir, she was fashioned by the self-same hand,
					And with more prodigal beauty than the rose; 
					Look at her, she will bear a closer glance. 
					'Tis old Cornelia's child, Camiola--- 
					You 'love a rose'? Kiss her, she'll taste as sweet.
				
					Isabella enters. 
				Julio.
					I dare not.
				Casti.
					Right: I am her cousin, Sir; 
					But I will make you known. Lord Guido comes.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.
					My father?
				Casti.
					Is not come yet. Let me touch 
					Your hand.
				Guido.
					Excellent Casti!---
					Julio, look! My aunt
					Has smiled for you this minute.
				Julio.
					I am gone.
				Guido.
					Am I the hero of this fête, dear Casti?
				Casti.
					You are, and you must honor it.
				Guido.
					I will: 
					It is the last.---Hark! hark! I hear a sound: 
					Oh!sheis coming.
				Casti.
					I hear nothing---nothing. 
					Come, be a man.
				Guido.
					A wretch.---Now then you hear.
				Casti.
					Ay, now: you're quick of ear.
				Guido.
					Ha! ha! a man who's flayed alive will feel 
					The merest touch: 'tis thus with me: my ear 
					Hath drunk in burning tidings; scalding words 
					Have been thrust near my brain.
					Music is heard.
				Casti.
					Your father comes.
				Julio.
					Madam, the Duke is coming. Gentlemen, 
					His Highness.
				
					Duke and Isidora enter. 
				Duke.
					Sit; Oh! sit.---No more of this 
					Authority puts off her state to-day, 
					And for once, we are equal.---Where's my son? 
					Gentlemen! Friends! I give you all a welcome. 
					Where is my son?
				Guido.
					My lord!
				Duke.
					Here is an old 
					Acquaintance, Isidora. Give my son 
					Welcome. He smiles upon us.
					Aside.
				Isid.
					Welcome, my lord!
				Guido.
					Madam, I thank you.
				Duke.
					Ha! Count Casti! you 
					Are known unto my wife; is it not so.
				Casti.
					Slightly I have been honored.
				Isid.
					Welcome, Sir, 
					Unto Mirandola. The Duke and I 
					Are glad to see so kind a countenance here.
				Duke.
					Oh! bravely. I shall teach you soon to know 
					The customs of a court: but, rest you now.--- 
					My friends! I pray ye, sit, and taste your welcome. 
					But how is this? There should be music here, 
					To greet my son after his battles.---Bid 
					The trumpet speak, and the fine thrilling harp 
					Chime in his ear, 'till every nerve is touched; 
					And let the flutes (like gentler voices) lend 
					Their pleasant tones, and the rich viols make, 
					With all their strings, harmonious noise to-night. 
					Strike forth, musicians, while the feast proceeds.
				
				Chorus.Welcome, welcome from afar;This is thy own festal day. 
				Welcome from the toil of war, 
				Son of great Mirandola.
				Julio.
					That was a pleasant strain.
				Lady.
					Most pleasant Sir.
				Duke.
					Stir not.
					
						Duke and Isidora rise.]  O! fair
						Camiola, take heed.---You do not wear 
					The ring I gave you, dearest. How was this?
				Isid.
					The ring?
				Duke.
					Aye, love: the ring I chose 
					From out a hundred, ruby cased in gold, 
					Shaped like a cross; I kissed it on your hand, 
					And swore upon that cross to love you ever. 
					Where is it?---But no matter; when we feast 
					Again, remember it---my favorite ring.
				Isid.
					I will, my lord.
				Duke.
					Now sit.---Give me a bowl 
					Of wine!---There is a troubled spirit still 
					Hanging about my heart. Some wine---enough. 
					I'll drown it quickly.---What a sparkling crown 
					(Beaded too royally) floats on the top 
					Of this clear liquid now, and tempts my taste. 
					Guido, my son, health and fair life be yours; 
					Your father speaks it with an earnest voice.
				Guido.
					But, for the heart---
				Casti.
					Nay, now I disagree. 
					Methinks his heart is in it.
				Guido.
					Excellent friend, 
					You always teach me well.---Father, I thank you.
				Duke.
					There is a cordial something in that word. 
					Father!---'twas thus he spoke, for the first time 
					Since his return, I think: 'Father!'---How lovely 
					My young bride looks. Beautiful, beautiful love! 
					How fair---how utterly without a peer 
					She is!---Apostate that I was to doubt: 
					And yet I did not: no, no, no: I did not. 
					Is that Hypolito?
				Hyp.
					Yes, my dear lord.
				Duke.
					Oh! reveller!--- 
					Sister, I have not noticed you; forgive't. 
					My heart was full of trouble and deep joy; 
					Strange company, you'll say for one so wise 
					As I am thought to be: but so it is.
				Isab.
					What was the matter with my sister?
				Duke.
					When?
				Isab.
					Just now: she seemed to shrink.
				Duke.
					From me? fromme?
					Oh! you mistake. More wine: fill high! 
					Gentlemen! a brave welcome to my son! 
					Guido, may discord never, never come 
					Between us.---Bring a goblet hither, Sirs, 
					And let him taste his welcome. Let the health 
					Pass round, and no one slight it. My dear son, 
					Give me your hand.---At Mantua once this---Ah!---
					He sees the ring.
				Julio.
					Look!---What's the matter with the Duke?
				Guido.
					My lord!
				Hyp.
					Look at my uncle, mother!
				Isab.
					Sir, be still!
				Lord.
					Come forward---How?
				Isid.
					My lord!---Ha!
				Guido.
					Father, speak, 
					What means this?
				Duke.
					Nothing. I am quiet---calm. 
					The heaven's are o'er us, and it may be---nothing. 
					It may be---Ha! begone!---Now, now, for ever 
					I cast aside goodness and faith and love, 
					No more to be put on---masks as they are, 
					To hide the base and villainous tricks of men. 
					Break up the feast! All leave us!---O bright Heaven! 
					Laugh you in scorn upon me! See it shines 
					Right through the windows, and the nodding pines 
					Shake their black heads and mock me.---Shall I swear 
					To kill?
				The guests go out.
				Guido.
					Father!
				Duke.
					That is---
				Guido.
					My lord!
				Duke.
					A lie, 
					Monstrous and foul, not to be said or thought.
				Isid.
					My gracious lord!
				Duke.
					False painted thing, begone!
				Isab.
					Nay---
				Duke
					Sister, will you drive me mad---outrageous? 
					I am abused---abused, I tell you. Ha! 
					Now do you start?
				Isab.
					Retire, sweet Isidora: 
					And you, dear Guido, bid Gheraldi come.
				Guido.
					Poor Isidora!---What a fate is thine?
					
						Guido and Isidora exeunt.] 
				Duke.
					Just when I had forgiven---almost forgot 
					All his most insolent taunts, all, and her cold 
					Unwilling smiles that made---that make me mad. 
					I could have loved her---like a fiery star, 
					I could have bent before her from my path 
					And worshipped her as something holy.---Now, 
					O, now!---
				Isab.
					Dear brother!
				Duke.
					Still am I the Duke. 
					Must you too put aside respect? No matter. 
					I'll keep my way alone, and burn away--- 
					Evil or good I care not, so I spread 
					Tremendous desolation on my road:--- 
					I'll be remembered as huge meteors are, 
					From the dismay they scatter.
				
					Gheraldi enters. 
				Gher.
					Gracious Sir!---
				Duke.
					I wish to be alone. 
					O earth and heaven! so fair, so lovely, yet 
					To be a---wretch. Now for all future time 
					I'll hate all things which seem as they were true, 
					For then they're false, I know. WhatIam
					I care not.---Father, draw yon curtain down; 
					Those sycophant branches with their bending leaves 
					Mock me: they mock my misery---my pain. 
					O how my heart aches!
				Isab.
					Brother, be composed.
				Duke.
					I cannot.---Will you pour upon my brain 
					Oblivion, or sweet balm over my heart? 
					No: then you jeer me when you bid me still 
					Be calm.---Would I were dull as Lethe is! 
					Or dead---dead: that were better; yet not so, 
					For I will live to be a terror still.
				Gher.
					My lord!---
				Duke.
					And yet,---were it not better, now, 
					To leave the world at once, and pass my age 
					In cell or forest?---this has been.
				Gher.
					My lord! 
					Perhaps the lady Isidora---
				Duke.
					Slave! 
					That word destroys me---tears me,---heart and soul. 
					Cannot I dream, or sleep, but thou must be 
					(My black familiar) at my elbow? Monk! 
					I hate your fawning---(Sister, stay your speech,) 
					I hate your sly insinuating smiles, 
					Your tongue that mocks your eyes, and tells a tale 
					As foul as night. I will not trust that tongue; 
					No, nor your eye, for both may be---are false. 
					Audacious slave!
				Isab.
					Dear brother, I must speak.
				Duke.
					I've heard of men who in a moment have 
					Done deeds of blood; but I---I will not thus 
					Redden my memory. Leave us, Monk---Begone!
					
						Gheraldi exit. 
				Isab.
					Dear brother, you---
				Duke.
					And you too go. 
					Go, Isabella:---Nay, it must be so. 
					Leave me to think.
				Isab.
					Farewell!
					Exit.
				Duke.
					To think---of what? 
					Of hell and all its horrors; for this earth, 
					It seems, may have a hell as full of pains, 
					And burning torture as was ever hid 
					In the dark bowels of the rolling world. 
					Places there are, 'tis said, where ill-starred souls 
					Pine amongst flames. My flames are in the heart, 
					And in the head---the brain, and every nerve. 
					And every trembling muscle of my frame. 
					O this hot ague! and my parching tongue 
					Clings close and closer still, and thro' my eyes 
					Run blood and fire, and---Ah!---O false, false, false! 
					Hush! some one comes. What! shall the Prince be jeered? 
					I'll fly into some corner dark as night.
				Exit.

				Isab.
					entering
					Where is the Duke?
				Curio.
					Now in his chamber, Madam: 
					But he has given orders that no one 
					Shall have admittance.
				Isab.
					Imustgo to him.
				Curio.
					Madam, you know how violent is the Duke: 
					He bid me keep the door.
				Isab.
					Go in, go in, Sir, 
					And tell him that I wish to see him, straight, 
					The matter's urgent. Go, Sir.
					
						Curio exit. 
				
				Casti.
					Without.
					Where is Lord Guido?
				Isab.
					How! 
					
						Casti enters with a letter. 
					Well, Sir?---
				Casti.
					Where is he,---Guido?
				Isab.
					Where?
				Casti.
					I must 
					See him directly. Can you not tell me where?
				Isab.
					Perhaps---
				Casti.
					Yes, yes.
				Isab.
					And yet he will not walk 
					To-night, tho' 'tis his hour:---but he may be 
					In the confessor's chamber. Do you know't?
				Casti.
					I'll find it, Madam.
				Isab.
					Yet it were as well, 
					If you should try the terrace first.
				Casti.
					I'll do't.
					Exit.
				Isab.
					That was well thought: now we have time at least.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.
					May I come in?
				Isab.
					Come in: I cannot gain 
					Admittance.
				Guido.
					I must see my father, Madam, 
					Let what will follow it.
				Isab.
					Do you know yet 
					What caused my brother's frenzy at the feast? 
					'Twas strange!
				Guido.
					Strange! It was madness. 
					Half of the ills we hoard within our hearts 
					Are ills because we hoard them. A fair tale 
					Will ever put down scandal, and the Duke 
					Wants but an open story. I will see him, 
					By Heaven!
				Isab.
					Be patient!
				Guido.
					Shall my heart be wrung 
					At every turn, and I know not the cause? 
					I were a fool indeed---Well, Sir, the Duke?
				
					Curio re-enters. 
				Curio.
					Madam, I dare not enter.
				Guido.
					Fool!---then I 
					Will go myself.
				Isab.
					No, no; I'll see him first. Trust me for once. 
					A woman's words---
				Guido.
					Then linger not.
				Isab.
					How's this? I've heard no noise.
				Curio.
					Madam, nor I 
					For the last hour.
				Guido.
					Great Heaven! what can it mean?
				Isab.
					Has he not spoken?
				Curio.
					No.
				Guido.
					Nor moved?
				Curio.
					He has not.
				Guido.
					I will go in, let what will happen.
				Isab.
					Stay!
				Curio.
					I'll venture since it must be so, my lord. 
					But may I beg you to withdraw.---This way.
				Guido.
					It cannot be.---Poor father!
				Curio.
					This way, Madam: 
					And I entreat your silence.
				Isab.
					Come: this way.
				Exeunt.
			SCENE II.
				The Duke's Chamber.
				The Duke is sitting alone.
				Curio.entering. He sleeps: Hush!---no,
						wide awake. 
					My lord! the lady Isabella is here. 
					My lord!---He does not answer me. My lord! 
					Ha! Madam, Madam, enter---Look!
				
					Isabella enters. 
				Isab.
					What's this? 
					Leave us.
					Exit Curio .]  Dear brother, will you be the
					talk Of your own servants? Give me your hand: how cold! 
					Speak!---why are you alone?
				Duke.
					Alone---alone.
				Isab.
					Nay, this 
					Is idle.
				Duke.
					Who---Ah! sister, is it you? 
					'Tis a cold day---dull as December.
				Isab.
					'Tis 
					Indeed a wretched day.
				Duke.
					Indeed? Ah! now 
					I recollect.---Oh! mercy! mercy!---Hear 
					Heaven and earth and air, if I---if I--- 
					But no, I will not curse them: thro' the world 
					A curse will follow them, like the black plague 
					Tracking their footsteps ever,---day and night--- 
					Morning and eve,---summer and winter,---ever, 
					I would not be a wretch so followed for 
					The wide supremacy of all the air. 
					I'd not be such a wretch---O Heaven! O Heaven! 
					Am I not worse than they are?
				Isab.
					Worse,---how worse?
				Duke.
					Oh, more---more desolate.
				Isab.
					Guido.
				Duke.
					No more.
				Isab.
					He asks to see you.
				Duke.
					We will meet hereafter: 
					In the world, never. In the grave perhaps--- 
					In the dark common chamber of the dead 
					We'll visit, where upon his shadowy steed 
					(Pale as a corpse) the speechless phantom rides, 
					Our king and enemy: there, friends and foes 
					Meet without passions, and the sickly light 
					That glimmers thro' the populous homes of death 
					Will be enough to find us. We shall know 
					Each other there, perhaps.
				Isab.
					His was indeed 
					A grievous fault; but he may mend. He's shrewd, 
					And he may clear himself. Shall he come in?
				Duke.
					No: and when I talk thus---thus calmly, you 
					Know well I mean my words.
				Isab.
					Nay---
				Duke.
					Nay; I am 
					As firm as marble: fixed as fate: no more. 
					Now, what's the day's amusement? Is't to hunt,
					Or fish, or sail, or fly the falcon?---what? 
					Or shall we drop upon our knees and pray?
				Isab.
					He says he must be heard.
				Duke.
					He must? Must!---Then 
					Bid him come in.
				Isab.
					You jest.
				Duke.
					Not I, by justice!---So---
					sits] that's well. I seem To sit in judgment. Were the
						world before me--- 
					The sinner, and the saint,---the prodigal, 
					And he who hoards his gold, and they who give 
					Not even a thought in charity,---base slaves, 
					Stabbers and thieves, and parricides, I'd hold 
					The balance firmly. Isabella, go. 
					Sirs, bid my son approach.
				Isab.
					I fear---well, well.
					Exit.
				Duke.
					There was a Roman who condemned his son 
					To death. I'll pass a gentler sentence, tho'
					I am myself the victim. It is strange; 
					But I do feel within me a calm glow, 
					As tho' the words I am about to say 
					Bore on their sound conviction. Can it be 
					That I have erred? Away, away:---if ever 
					I rise to hope I shall grow wild again. 
					Despair is better. Hark! he comes; my blood 
					Is half in tumult,---yet I will be calm.
				
					Guido enters. 
				Guido.
					Father!
				Duke.
					Lord Guido, I am told you wish 
					An audience; is it so?
				Guido.
					It is.
				Duke.
					Speak on. 
					If you have suffered wrong and pray relief, 
					Why, you should have it.---If you have done wrong, 
					The church is open, and the gate of Heaven 
					Wide for a true repenter.
				Guido.
					Oh! my lord, 
					I beg you to cast off this garb.
				Duke.
					It is 
					The garb of justice; treat it with honour, Sir, 
					As you may hope to thrive. Well!
				Guido.
					Why is this?
				Duke.
					Why! have you aught to ask? if so, speak on.
				Guido.
					My lord, I know not how it is, but you 
					Who (if I must speak truth) have wrong'dmemuch,
					Assume the injured man. What have I done?--- 
					You will not answer?---no?
				Duke.
					Go on, go on. 
					I like your boldness,---not your spirit. Well!
				Guido.
					What have I done, my lord?
				Duke.
					What done!---but speak.
				Guido.
					You think me traitor, as I hear; but surely 
					I were a sorry knave, to plot against 
					The state which will be mine.
				Duke.
					Be not too sure. 
					Proceed.
				Guido.
					That's as you will, my lord:---but away with this. 
					My lord, my lord! I ask you, can I be 
					The same in soul as when we fought at Mantua--- 
					Together,---side by side? I hate to name it: 
					But, did I not---I ask you, did I not 
					Once do you service?
				Duke.
					Yes: I own to that. 
					You speak it doubtfully: you saved my life. 
					Pray, be not sparing. I can bear it all.
				Guido.
					Have I deserved this, Sir? Great Heaven!
				Duke.
					Silence! 
					You have affronted Heaven; and the sad day 
					(Now dying) leaves a blush upon the face 
					Of the great sky, faint as your honour.---You 
					Have practised against Heaven,---against me.
				Guido.
					I have not, by my hopes: nay, hear me swear--- 
					If I have done---done what? I know not what. 
					But if I ever gave you cause to hate me,--- 
					If I have wronged you by myself, or e'er 
					Conspired with others,---plotted, writ, or thought,--- 
					Nay, if I ever heard of foes to you 
					And lent them help or countenance---strike me down! 
					I call on you, bright Heaven! I call on all 
					Your terrible thunders and blue darting fires 
					Quickly to come upon me. If my words 
					Are false, strike me to nothing!
				Duke.
					Well, Sir, I 
					Have heard.
				Guido.
					And doubt me still?
				Duke.
					Doubt! 
					If you have said? you have: why then good even. 
					Now we may go and pray.
				Guido.
					Once more.---That ring--- 
					(The Duchess' ring) was given me as a pledge 
					Of a pure friendship.
				Duke.
					Ha!
				Guido.
					Oh! my lord, do not doubt me.---Once more, Sir, 
					I ask you to remember what I was, 
					And now believe.---My lord!---Nay,---not a word? 
					Not one?---Then is my purpose strong. My lord, 
					I see that 'tis in vain to hope to stay 
					In quiet at Mirandola. Each hour 
					Would bring a host of troubles and of fears 
					On me,---or both, perhaps: and I've enough 
					Therefore, unless your highness orders that 
					I must remain, I purpose speedily 
					(To-night, indeed) to travel.
				Duke.
					Travel!---where? 
					Where do you think to travel?
				Guido.
					I know not where: somewhere about the world. 
					What matters it where I am?
				Duke.
					This is sudden. 
					Your resolution's sudden,---but 'tis wise. 
					You have my full consent,---my wish: what more?
				Guido.
					Will you not say farewell?
				
				Duke.rising. Shall you stop first 
					At Naples?
				Guido.
					First at Rome.
				Duke.
					Perhaps you may hear further from me there.
				Guido.
					Yet say farewell.
				Duke.
					Farewell.
				Guido.
					Oh, Father, I 
					Am going far---for ever. This cold hand, 
					Which now I stretch abroad towards you,---now, 
					You'll never touch again.
				Duke.
					Farewell!---Mountains and seas 
					Must rise and roll between us: then, perhaps, 
					We may be friends again. I loved you once--- 
					Once for your mother's sake; ay, for your own. 
					I had brave hopes, but you have blighted them;--- 
					But I may write to Rome.
				Guido.
					I hope you will.
				Duke.
					If what I think is wrong: no matter, you 
					Shall hear from me at Rome.
				Guido.
					At Rome, then.
				Duke.
					If 
					My power, or my purse be wanting---ever, 
					(Death! I shall play the fool!)---if ever I 
					Can serve you, let me know, and 't shall be done. 
					This from my old affection will I do. 
					Some one has used me ill---some one has struck 
					And tortured me. Let me look on you.---You 
					Had always a brave look;---ay, from a boy.
				Guido.
					I wore my innocence there, and in my heart.
				Duke.
					Well, well; no more; you'll see the Duchess ere 
					You leave us.
				Guido.
					No, my lord.
				Duke.
					You'll see her? Nay---
				Guido.
					'Tis better not. I leave Mirandola 
					To-night.
				Duke.
					But first---
				Guido.
					Pray, spare me.
				Duke.
					Then---why then 
					Fare you well, Guido; for it must come to that 
					At last.---Farewell! yet, wheresoe'er you go, 
					Still do not quite forget Mirandola. 
					You have had happy hours and pleasant thoughts, 
					And I---I have had some: in infancy 
					I---(tho' I was a prince) would not confide 
					My son to hirelings. I have stood and watched 
					You sleeping, (then I dared not own you, for 
					My father lived,) while poor Bianca wept. 
					Oh! I have watch'd you with a cotter's care, 
					Thro' many and many a night:---'tis so; and now 
					Mountains and stormy seas will come between 
					Our hearts. While you are wandering, I shall be 
					Shut in my palace,---prisoned up,---a slave: 
					What else are princes ever? but I'll write 
					To Rome.
				Guido.
					I shall expect it.
				Duke.
					Confide in me. 
					I thought I had a word or two to say, 
					But they are gone;---the common things, perhaps, 
					Men say at parting: likely nothing more. 
					You may return: if not, why let us part 
					Like friends at least: hate is a galling load 
					To bear in absence; so---farewell. Oh! Guido! 
					Embraces him.
					And now, no more. Farewell!
				Guido.
					Once more, farewell, 
					Farewell!
					Exit.
				Duke.
					Farewell! The kindest breath of Heaven 
					Rest on your head and hallow it.---My son! 
					My only son! and is he gone for ever? 
					HowI haveloved him let these tremulous hands
					Proclaim, and these my weeping woman's eyes, 
					Not often stained with tears.---Farewell, once more. 
					Son of my youth! And now I'll take one look 
					At the blue sky, and taste the scents which hang 
					Around the flowers.---Methinks I feel again 
					My stature princely, and still running clear 
					The high blood of Mirandola.
				Exit.
			SCENE III.
				The Apartment of the Confessor.
				
					Gheraldi discovered at a Table, with Papers; and a Chest open,
					to and from which he goes. 
				Gher.
					Now, haughty lady, now indeed thy nets 
					Are closing round thy victims: but thou art 
					Thyself within my mesh.---I want thy help, 
					To thrust me in the conclave; until then 
					I'll keep thy secrets safely,---and thy letters. 
					Ha! this---
					Reads.] "To Guido de Mirandola, Naples."---That Gaspero had
						an honest look; 
					And yet he was a knave. This---"To the Father 
					Gheraldi." Signed "Thy true friend Isabella." 
					This is my bill on fortune---"thy true friend." 
					And here are Guido's letters to the Duke 
					I would not lose them for a mitre. But 
					There is another---Ha!
					Goes to the chest.
				
					Casti enters suddenly. 
				Casti.
					Is not Lord Guido here?
				Gher.
					Signior!---Lord Guido?
				Casti.
					Ay, Sir, Lord Guido.---I must see him quickly. 
					Why, what's the matter, Monk?
				
				Guido.
					Within.
					In this room, say you?
				Casti.
					Ha! that is his voice? 
					
						Guido enters. 
					My dear Guido! I want 
					Some private words---I want to have some speech 
					With the lord Guido, Sir.
				Gher.
					With the lord Guido?
				Casti.
					Death! 
					Do you not hear? We wish to talk in private.
				Guido.
					You'll trust us in your room awhile, Gheraldi?
				Gher.
					My lord,---my papers.
				Casti.
					Never mind them, Monk. 
					How! do you think we wish to learn how well 
					You turn a cunning verse? leave 'em and go.
				Gher.
					My lord, I must---
				Guido.
					How!---I have spoken, Sir, 
					Waves him off.
					Some minutes hence you may return.
				Gher.
					But first---
					Seizes the papers.
				Casti.
					Begone!
					As Gheraldi goes, he thrusts the papers into his robe:---some fall, as
						Casti hurries him out.
				Casti.
					Now, 
					I have a message.
				Guido.
					You must say it quickly; 
					For I am going.
				Casti.
					Going---where?
				Guido.
					I leave 
					Mirandola this hour.
				Casti.
					For what? for what?
				Guido.
					My friend, the Duke and I must part. Nay, spare me: 
					It is determined on. I go to-night.
				Casti.
					To-night you must not; for the Duchess asks,--- 
					Implores a meeting with you.---In my hand 
					I hold her letter: look! 'twas written with 
					A trembling heart.
				Guido.
					Poor Isidora! so 
					Thy young heart trembled when it wrote to me. 
				Reads.] Ha! Casti---stay, stay: how! to-night? to-night?
					It cannot be: I've said---
				Casti.
					And I have sworn, 
					Upon the Duchess' hand, that you shall see her. 
					You must---Oh! no excusing.
				Guido.
					My dear friend, 
					There are some trials which the mind (tho' made 
					Ev'n hard by sorrow) cannot go through well: 
					Such one is this.
				Casti.
					She wept,---do you not hear? 
					She wept and bade me as I loved her honour, 
					Her life,---to bring you to her.
				Guido.
					How can I 
					See her? I go this hour.
				Casti.
					You can, you can: 
					Cannot you leave your horses at the inn 
					(The first you arrive at) near the mountains? then 
					You can return alone, wrapt in your cloak. 
					Who'll know of this? 'tis easy. Why, the night 
					Itself will shroud you well.
				Guido.
					But should the Duke---
				Casti.
					Do I not tell you that perhaps her life--- 
					Her very life's at stake.
				Guido.
					Well!---
				Casti.
					Well---you must do't.
				Guido.
					We must be secret; yes, 
					We must be very secret,---but I'll do't. 
					There is a fate in this.
					I seem to go
					Calmly, yet with a melancholy step, 
					Onwards and onwards.---Is there not a tale 
					Of some man, (an Arabian as I think,) 
					Who sailed upon the wide sea many days, 
					Tossing about, the sport of winds and waters, 
					Until he saw an isle, towards which his ship 
					Turned suddenly?---there is: and he was drawn, 
					As by a magnet on, slowly, until 
					The vessel neared the isle: and then, it flew 
					Quick as a shooting star, and dash'd itself 
					To pieces. Methinks I am this man.---But be it. 
					I'll go to Isidora.
				
					Andrea and Carlo enter. 
				Casti.
					Well!
				Andrea.
					My lord, 
					Your horses wait.
				Casti.
					Now?
				Andrea.
					In the court, my lord.
				Guido.
					Farewell, then: I shall see you once more.
				Casti.
					You 
					Will not deceive me?
				Guido.
					I will not, my friend. 
					I'll see you after I have seen her: now, 
					Farewell.
				Casti.
					Farewell then.---I will stay 
					Here; lest our parting (colder than should be 
					'Tween friends) give rise to doubts.
				Guido.
					Right.---Fare thee well!
					Exeunt Guido, Andrea and Carlo .
					
				Casti.
					Poor Guido!---I have done my task; altho' 
					I hate these secret meetings. What I do 
					I wish the sun to see; yet, I have been 
					A messenger to him:---Well, perhaps---So, 
					takes up the papers.
					What have we?---the monk's homilies, or---Ha! 
					What!---to Lord Guido, signed by---by the Duke? 
					Death! it all strikes upon me. This is not 
					opens the pacquet.
					A time for doubting. What is this? Ah! Heaven!
				
					Gheraldi enters. 
				Gher.
					I must have dropped some---Ha! Signior! 
					My lord, this is not well. My lord, I say!
				Casti.
					Begone, thou villain!---This
				reads
				from Guido to
				The Duke?
				Gher.
					Give me my letters, Sir.
				Casti.
					Another!---How! 
					Oh! mercy! thou'rt betray'd, poor friend, betray'd. 
					Thou avarice bitten slave!
				Gher.
					Give---give me but 
					Those letters, Sir, and you shall have---
				Casti.
					Insolent slave!
				Gher.
					Not for myself, not for myself, my lord; 
					But for the lady Isabella.
				Casti.
					Ha!
				Gher.
					She'll thank you---she'll reward you: you shall have--- 
					I know not what.
				Casti.
					By Heaven, her writings here 
					To you---to you, you mean, and loathsome worm! 
					Ha! signed "your true friend Isabella."
					He reads, holding the letters away from Gheraldi .
					
				Gher.
					Sir--- 
					My lord! my lord!
					Clings to Casti . 
				Casti.
					'Tis here, 'tis here! Begone! I see it now--- 
					I see it all.---Oh, Guido! poor lost friend! 
					But it is here---thy proof! andthyproof too,
					Thou double slave!---Begone!
				Gher.
					I'll give you all!--- 
					I have a mighty hoard---of gold---of gems---
				Casti.
					Unloose me, villain!---This shall to the Duke!
				Gher.
					My lord, my life is in it.
				Casti.
					Guido's life: 
					His honor! but they shall be saved. Begone!
				Gher.
					I cannot---will not.
				Casti.
					Slave! Ha! villain, down!
				Gher.
					My lord, I'll be for ever---I will kneel---
				Casti.
					Hence!---Now we triumph.
				Gher.
					Go not!
				Casti.
					To the Duke: 
					Ay, to the Duke in triumph: Thou shalt be--- 
					Begone!---Ha! villain!---Nay, then thus I dash 
					You down for ever.---Hence!---Now then, my friend, 
					Now victory is ours. Honor---thy father's love, 
					Saved, and thy princely name made clear for ever. 
					Now for the Duke.---Away!
				Exeunt.
			
		
		ACT V.
			SCENE I.
				The Apartment of the Duchess.
				Duke, Isidora.
				Duke.
					Sweet, talk no more of this. Sorrow has past 
					Over us like a storm:---my heart is stilled; 
					And, though more lonely than I thought to live, 
					We'll make the best of life.
					Poor policy
					It is to shun the few bright hours that come, 
					'Cause more are absent from us. Let us be 
					Happy, love, if not gay. Come; sit beside me. 
					Why do you stand, dear Isidora?
				Isid.
					I--- 
				Aside] The hour is past: he must be waiting. Now Excuse
					me.
				Duke.
					Presently. Come sit by me; 
					And let me tell you once more how I love you, 
					How utterly and self-abandoned I 
					Gave my whole soul to you. Oh! pardon, then, 
					(Pardon for this devotion's sake,) that I 
					Ever pronounced a word that look'd like anger, 
					Fear, or a false mistrust. I gave up all: 
					Could I ask less than all? Why, what is't moves you?
				
				Isid.
					aside.
					How shall I pass?---I will return.
				Duke.
					How's this? have you lost aught?
				Isid.
					Yes, my lord, yes. I---I shall not be long 
					Ere I return.
				Duke.
					Well; go then, if it must 
					Be so: but take heed, dearest; do not walk 
					Abroad so late again. I would not have 
					Evil to meet you for---for the wide world. 
					Quickly return.
				Isid.
					I will, my lord, I will. 
					Exit Isidora . 
				Duke.
					The calm I feel upon me is more like 
					A leaden grief than joy,---and yet 'tis joy: 
					Not the high buoyant spirit which lit up 
					Mine eye this morning: 'tis a sullen light, 
					But it has full possession. Every nerve 
					Is laden with a strange and lulling charm, 
					As tho' I had drank of poppies, yet alive 
					To the least touch. A sound would startle me. 
					Hark!---no.---What could my Isidora mean? 
					She trembled, yet she is not wont to tremble for 
					A trifling loss. 'Twas odd.---Again! Who's there?
				
				Isabella
					without.
					Brother!
				Duke.
					Come in, come in. 
				
					Isabella enters. 
				Why, what is this? 
				Are you not well?
				Isab.
					Not quite. Dear brother, where--- 
					Where is the Duchess?
				Duke.
					Gone. She will return 
					Quickly: till then, remain.
				Isab.
					Did she go out 
					Lately?
				Duke.
					But now unto her chamber.
				Isab.
					Then 
					It could not be; and yet---no, 'tcould not be.
				Duke.
					What could not be?
				Isab.
					Dear brother!
				Duke.
					What is this? 
					Speak, Isabella.---By the gods, you seem 
					Born to perplex me. Speak out.
				Isab.
					It is nothing.
				Duke.
					Nothing?
				Isab.
					Perhaps 'tis nothing.
				Duke.
					I shall be 
					Vexed beyond all my reason.
					I thank the stars
					I am not of that humour which delights 
					In fretting this and that man,---thus and thus, 
					With question and no answer,---flat denial, 
					And then "perhaps," and "it may not be so;"--- 
					I hate it all. By Jupiter, if I 
					Had now a secret (good or ill no matter) 
					Which it became a friend to know---
				Isab.
					What then?
				Duke.
					I'd speak it boldly.
				Isab.
					Then---why then---I cannot.
				Duke.
					Gods! give me patience.---Isabella, if 
					You cannot speak, leave me; (I am not used 
					To talk thus, but you fret me.) Secret!---what? 
					What secret can it be? Ha!---no, no, no. 
					You asked me of the Duchess?
				Isab.
					Did she go 
					Unto her chamber?
				Duke.
					Yes.
				Isab.
					You're sure of that?
				Duke.
					Sure? yes; where else? sure! sure!
				Isab.
					Then I am wrong.
				Duke.
					Darkness and death! speak out---what is it?
				Isab.
					Nay, 
					Be calm.
				Duke.
					As the loud thunder:---Well; I'm calm.
				Isab.
					I thought I saw 
					Beneath the moonlight---
				Duke.
					Yes; go on, go on.
				Isab.
					I would not tell you, but I cannot live 
					And see you wronged.
				Duke.
					Go on.
				Isab.
					I thought I saw 
					Guido, and---
				Duke.
					Hell!---but no, it cannot be.
				Isab.
					And yet, my servant, Pesaro---
				Duke.
					Drag him in.
				Isab.
					I'll bring him to you.
					Exit.
				Duke.
					Haste: make haste.---Oh, shame! 
					My son!---If it be so?---If it be---Why then 
					Come forth, thou power of Darkness! Come abroad 
					And shroud the world! No;---rather let there be 
					Earthquake, and tumbling towns, and fiery rain, 
					Vapours, and spotted fever,---thick disease--- 
				
					Isabella re-enters. 
				Ah! sister---Well; where is he?
				Isab.
					Come in!
				
					Pesaro enters. 
				Duke.
					Now,---
				Isab.
					Be calm. Speak, Pesaro.
				Pes.
					My lord!---If I---
				Duke.
					Plagues blister you. Villain, speak on. 
					Whom have you seen? seen what?
				Pes.
					Lord Guido.
				Duke.
					That 
					Is false: he has left the city.
				Pes.
					Yes, my lord: 
					But he returned. I saw him near the barrier, 
					(Wrapped in his cloak) not half an hour ago: 
					And now---
				Duke.
					I dream.
				Isab.
					Well, well; you saw---?
				Pes.
					Just now 
					I saw him in the garden.
				Isab.
					And alone?
				Pes.
					I think I saw the Duchess.
				Isab.
					Now leave us. 
					Brother!
					Exit Pesaro . 
				Duke.
					Look down, look down!
				Isab.
					I should have thought 
					Less of this strange return, had I not seen him 
					(Yet why should that have struck me?) smile upon 
					That ring.
				Duke.
					Ha!
				Isab.
					When he parted with you---yes: 
					And then---how can I bear to name it? Yet, 
					Your court all smile and talk of this---their past 
					Love, and their---meeting in her chamber.
				Duke.
					Ring! Chamber! I loiter:---I will have 
					Such---such revenge. Where is my dagger---where? 
					I cannot find't; 'tis better. I will have 
					Vengeance in open day.
				Isab.
					Nay,---
					Interposing.]
				Duke.
					Death and shame! 
					Away, away!
					Rushes out.
				Isab.
					He's gone.---I almost tremble. 
					And yet I will not. I, who never yet 
					Knew what it was to fear,---shall I shrink now? 
					He's gone, and they---no, no; he will not find 
					My victims soon.---My son shall be a prince. 
					A prince!---a noble sound.---I tremble still. 
					Who's there?---What noise is that?
				
					Casti comes in suddenly with papers, followed by
						Gheraldi . 
				Casti.
					Where is the Duke?
				Gher.
					Thank God! he is not here.
				Isab.
					What means this tumult, Sir?
				Casti.
					Oh! lady you--- 
					Are you there? Shame! where is the Duke?
					Enters an apartment.
				Gher.
					He has 
					Discovered all.---What shall be done?
				Isab.
					Hush! I 
					Must think.---Meantime call you the guard. 
					Quick, quick! Ha! I must stop this choleric sir.
					
						Gheraldi exit. 
				
				Casti.returning. He is not there; Madam!
						Nay, 
					I must pass.
				Isab.
					Ha!---ha! what is this outrage? Guards!
				Casti.
					By Heaven!
					attempts to pass her.
				Isab.
					Within there---Guards, I say! 
					
						Gheraldi, Pesaro and Soldiers enter. 
					Count Casti has 
					Forgot himself, and me. You will take care 
					The Count does not escape. Confine him, Sir, 
					Until my brother is at leisure. I 
					Will answer this: he has done outrage here.
				Casti.
					I have some news, good Lucio,---news to tell 
					The Duke; so give me way.
					Thrusts the papers in his bosom.
				Isab.
					Sir, take him hence.
				Casti.
					Madam---
				Isab.
					Away!
					Exeunt soldiers, &c. with Casti . 
				Gher.
					Madam, you are a quick contriver.
				Isab.
					Now, 
					Let us go hence: no talk.---There is a thing 
					That now will soon be done; and then our cares 
					(My cares) are over. If I die, my son 
					Reigns in Mirandola. And yet, take care 
					The Count is safe.---I have a task elsewhere.
				Exeunt severally.
			SCENE II.
				A Garden.---Clouded Moonlight.
				Guido, Isidora.
				Isid.
					When I wrote to you I knew not 
					That ye were reconciled. Oh! had I known 
					That you had left Mirandola, for the world 
					I'd not have put you in this peril: but 
					That ring---it seemed to me honor and life.
				Guido.
					Not life.
				Isid.
					Oh! yes, to me: his violent spirit would 
					Soon have destroyed me. Even now, should he learn 
					Of this our meeting---Oh! I fear, I fear--- 
					Nay, give it to me.
				Guido.
					My pretty ring! must you then have it?
				Isid.
					Yes. 
					And 'tis not well indeed, my lord, that you 
					Should wear my favors now. Some busy tongues 
					May talk.
				Guido.
					Oh! Isidora, is it come 
					To this? Must innocence so scant her looks, 
					Or modesty be dumb, lest the base crowd 
					Abuse her?
					Oh! fair Heaven, they're bitter times
					And doubtful when a breath of air may blow 
					Our names away. But take it.
					Gives the ring.] See--- I part with my last good, but 'tis
						to thee. 
					When I am gone---Shame on this blinding tear! 
					One drop, and yet how bitter!
				Isid.
					Talk not thus: 
					You may return.
				Guido.
					Oh! never shall that be. 
					There is a period in the days of men,
					Beyond which they never thrive. I have seen mine: 
					Now, all is darkness and decay.
				Isid.
					Alas!
				Guido.
					Oh! weep not, weep not, Isidora. You 
					Had once a braver spirit.
				Isid.
					I will try 
					To say farewell calmly.
				Guido.
					Sweet blessings rest 
					Upon your head for ever!---I shall go 
					Afar; yet do not thou forget me. We 
					Have known each other long. Fortune has been 
					Our foe. Our very youth is gone before 
					It's time, and we must part.---
					Oh! Isidora,
					Think of me sometimes: amidst crowds and revels 
					You'll be a queen: pomp and admiring eyes 
					Will follow you, and delicate music, like 
					Incense from Heav'n, will haunt around your rooms. 
					Yet, in the midst of all do not forget 
					The mountain song we used to sing together: 
					'Tis long ago; but 'twas a pleasant strain. 
					I love it still; better methinks than ever.
				Isid.
					Do not talk thus. I cannot bear it.
				Guido.
					Nay, 
					Weep not. Poor Isidora!
				Isid.
					Poor, indeed.
				Guido.
					Give me your hand, once more.
				Isid.
					Oh! Guido! Guido!
				Guido.
					We must part, dear friend. 
					And I must say---what must at last be said; 
					Tis only---this:---I cannot, by the light 
					Of Heaven, I cannot say it. What! Farewell 
					To thee, whom I have loved---Oh! loved beyond 
					All words, all parallel, by day and night, 
					In health, in sickness, amidst toils and dangers---? 
					By heaven, I cannot do't.
				Isid.
					Hush! what is that?
				Guido.
					O Night!
				Isid.
					Hush!---no, 'twas nothing. Now---
				Guido.
					Farewell! 
					Must it be so, indeed?
				Isid.
					It must.
				Guido.
					Why then 
					Farewell; and yet---there is a boon at parting 
					Which mere acquaintance to each other give: 
					Shall it be less with us? Oh! we have loved 
					Dearly and long.
				Isid.
					That's past.
				
					Duke rushes in, and stops suddenly. 
				Duke.
					I've sought 'em---Ha!
				Guido.
					Nay, Isidora!---
				Duke.
					Ha! ha! ha!---Oh! Devils. 
					Winter, and blight, and famine strike ye down: 
					And fires, broad as the deluge, rain, 'till they 
					Scorch all the land up,---all.
				Guido.
					Shun not my last 
					Request; it is my last.---
					Tho' dark fortune puts
					Her arm between us, every gentle proof 
					Of what has been, we need not cast aside. 
					Oh! weep not. Let me take one kiss away 
					In memory of thee---one: it will be 
					The saddest, yet the sweetest,---and the last.
				Isid.
					No, Guido
				Guido.
					Then farewell: shrink not.
				Isid.
					I faint. Your father---
					Sinks against Guido . 
				Guido.
					Tremble not. Where is he?
				
					Duke rushes forward. 
				Duke.
					Here!--- 
					Here, serpents!---Now the everlasting curse 
					Cling to ye both and wither. May ye both 
					Wander about---
				Guido.
					I---
				Duke.
					Wretch!---wander about 
					The world,---the wide world, hopeless, vile, abhorred. 
					But no; for you---(will my head burst?) for you, 
					Delicate Sin, begone---yet stay: if e'er 
					You shall repent---repent of what? ha, ha! 
					Who's the accuser? none: who will believe 
					That I'm abused, abused? who'll swear? none, none. 
					Ha, ha!---O Death and Night!
				Guido.
					Will you not hear?
				Duke.
					Ay, when you die I'll listen,---I'll rejoice. 
					Will you have trial? never: there are crimes 
					Which the law touches not; but I'll have blood 
					Red as the Arab gulph: not your's, but you--- 
					You with the curse of Cain---worse, worse---with all 
					The blight of parricide upon you---Son! 
					(No son of mine!)---Ah!---how my tongue is parched--- 
					Dry as a withered scroll.---I will have such 
					Vengeance---such mighty vengeance.
				Guido.
					Once more---nay---
				Duke.
					Parricide!
				Guido.
					'Tis in vain.
				Isid.
					Alas! Alas!
				Duke.
					What! do you weep and cheat me of all tears? 
					But I'll have justice.
				Guido.
					Yet hear!
				Duke.
					Not a word: 
					No, not a word. I listened once, and died. 
					Ho, ho!---the world's abroad: lights! torches! so--- 
					Come on, come on.
				Guido.
					Spareher. For me---
				Duke.
					For you 
					There is a something yet. Come in, I say. 
				My soul is white.---How my head throbs! Stir not. Where am
					I?
				
					Curio, Piero , Guards and Attendants enter. 
				Curio.
					Stay! What tumult is there here? 
					Your highness?
				Duke.
					Where? The Duke is dead---is dead. 
					He died, Sir, when his wife and son forsook him: 
					But I am here to represent his state, 
					And it shall find full justice. Where's the throne? 
					Vanish'd, alas!---no matter. I will sit 
					Beneath the stars.

				Hide the pale visage of the moon. And now, 
				I call upon the assembled lights of Heaven; 
				And on the immortality of Truth, 
				Upon white Chastity, and crown'd Revenge, 
				To attest what here I do. Traitors! draw near. 
				What have ye---(Mark! the huge and ponderous sky 
				Hangs right above your heads,)---to say? Speak forth!
				Guido.
					Father!
				Duke.
					I'll not admit that voice; 'tis perjured. Hark! 
					Did it not thunder then? no: all is still--- 
					Calm as despair.

					Hush! Music.---Hush! 
					
						Isid. comes forward. 
					Ah! is it you?
				Isid.
					Spare him, O spare him!
				Duke.
					Never.

					If---

					If a word is spoken, but a word,---
				Guido.
					Nay, hear me. 
					That ring, that ring---
				Duke.
					Ha! do you taunt me, villain? 
					Blights wither you!
				Isid.
					Alas!
				Duke.
					Come hither, slave! 
					You, sirrah! what's your name? no matter. Take 
					Yon man into the palace-court, and there--- 
					Come nearer---near. 
					Whispers officer.
					Remember!
				
				Isid.
					Shrieks.
					Ha!---What's that? 
					Oh! mercy, mercy. Spare him---spare us both. 
					My lord!---O husband!
				
				Guido.
					Sweet, implore no more. 
					My fate is come. I'll meet it as a man. 
					Of thee I dare not think: butthou---
				Duke.
					Speak on. 
					You shall have licence,---once---but once. Speak on.
				Guido.
					Thou hast abused 
					Thy trusts of father, husband, prince.
				Isid.
					No, no.
				Guido.
					Thou hast, to glut a base and bitter hate, 
					Destroyed thine only son. Angels now look 
					Upon us, and before their homes I swear 
					That I am innocent. Remember this. 
					For her who stands palely beside you there, 
					(A star amidst this darkness,) she is pure 
					As Heaven. I speak this with a dying tongue. 
					I loved her---
				Duke.
					Ha! shall this be said? Away, 
					Away, I say! If once I swear---
					Rises.
				Guido.
					One word,---
				Isid.
					One word.
				Guido.
					Poor Isidora!
				Isid.
					One---
				Guido.
					One word's enough. My lord, when I depart, 
					To where---no matter, mark me. I shall tread 
					With the same step,---the same bold, faithful step, 
					Which bore me on, 'midst fire and carnage, when 
					I saved your life at Mantua.---Now, lead on.
					
						Guido exit with officers. 
				
				Duke.Sinks down. He's gone.
				Isid.
					A moment stop. My lord! my lord! 
					Spare him. I'll kneel to you, and wet the dust 
					With tears. Oh! husband, my dear husband! speak! 
					I,---Isidora---Isidora, whom 
					You loved so once, am here---here on my knees, 
					Before the world,---in the broad light. My lord! 
					Give him but time,---a word---(do you hear that?) 
					A word will clear him. Will you not listen? Oh!--- 
					Cruel, oh! cruel! Mercy, yet;---oh, God!
					
						Isidora falls before him. 
				
				Piero.
					after a pause.
					Shall we not help the Duchess?
				Curio.
					Stay, stay: he 
					Begins to move.
				Piero.
					He looks like marble with those fixed eyes.
				Curio.
					Ha! those are heavy tears.
				Officer.
					Hark!
				Duke.
					Mercy!--- 
					No more of that. I am a desolate man: 
					Much injured; almost mad. I want---I'll have 
					Vengeance---tremendous vengeance. Ha! pale thing; 
					I will not tread upon her. Tears? what, tears? 
					Take her away. 
				
				
					Isidora is taken out. 
				My heart is cold as lead. 
				I should have had a cloak to cover me--- 
				A tomb, a tomb, to keep the wind out. Ha! 
				I love this lonely pomp. My lamps are hung 
				All round a mighty dome; and music, like 
				The noises bursting from AEolian caves, 
				Come round me like a charm. Oh! I have been 
				Betrayed; ay, and revenged.---All silent? How! 
				Come, talk, Sirs, talk.
				
					Isabella enters. 
				Officer.
					Will not your highness go?
				Duke.
					Go? where? where? Ah! the light comes. I have been 
					Long wandering. Misery! oh, misery! 
					But justice shall be done; and vengeance.

					Ha!
				Gher.
					Madam, he has escaped.
				Isab.
					Be still, Sir. Who?
				Pes.
					Count Casti.
				Isab.
					Ha! go seek him, and confine him: 
					Do this, and you shall thrive. This is unlucky.
				Gher.
					'Tis death.
				Isab.
					Not quite so bad. Guido is gone 
					To rest.
				Gher.
					How the Duke sits!
				Isab.
					We'll lead him in. My lord!
				Duke.
					Ah! Sister. Well; justice is done.
				
				Casti.without. The Duke!
				Duke.
					What voice is that?
					
						Casti enters quickly. 
				Casti.
					The Duke---where is the Duke?
				Duke.
					Here,---on his seat of judgement.
				Casti.
					Seize the Monk. 
					My lord, pray pardon me, but---O my heart! 
					Madam, you must not go.
				Isab.
					Slave! dare you think 
					To daunt the sister of Mirandola?
				Duke.
					What's this?
				Casti.
					You are abused.
				Duke.
					I know it. Wretch! 
					Will you bring back my terrors? Silence him.
				Casti.
					You and your son are both abused,---betrayed. 
					You and your innocent wife. Look on the Monk. 
					Your son's as fair as Heaven. Mark the Monk, 
					I say. Here, my lord, here are letters,---scrawls 
					Fashioned in hell, too black for such a place. 
					Here are the letters which you sent to Naples. 
					Look! these your son writ; these---your sister sent. 
					I took them from the Monk: he bribed, and prayed, 
					Nay, wept and tore my cloak to get them, but 
					I have them here,---read, read!
				Duke.
					Letters? my son!---
				Casti.
					He met the Duchess here by my entreaty: 
					Against his wish he met her: nay---

					Ah, sister!

				Casti.
					Read, Sir!
				Isab.
					Slave! my son 
					Reigns in Mirandola. I am content.
				Casti.
					Lead out the lady.
					
						Isabella is taken out. 
				Duke.
					Now, where is she?---gone! 
					'Tis better. Ah! thou cowled villain,---thou 
					Whom I have loved and trusted. I forget: 
					Where am I? I am wandering yet.
				Casti.
					My lord! 
					Where is your son?
				Duke.
					My son? Ha! death and haste. 
					Fly, fly and save him. Bring him hither. Drag 
					That villain to a dungeon. O, my heart! 
					Fly some one! fly again, and bring my son. 
					Oh! mercy, mercy!
				Casti.
					Where is he---his son?
				Officer.
					Led out to death.
				Casti.
					Ha! where?
				Officer.
					In the western court.
					
						Casti rushes out. 
				Duke.
					My son! where is my son? Is no one gone 
					To stop my orders? Go---some more. I'll sit 
					Here, while the Heavens are trembling.

				Ha!
				Sinks down.
				 (After a short pause, Casti re-enters.) 
				Casti.
					My lord!
				Duke.
					Ha! my good messenger, a word, a word; 
					But one: I'll give my Dukedom to you,---all. 
					Tell me he lives. Swear it. 'Tis my command.
				Casti.
					Alas! it was too late. We can but pray.
				Duke.
					Rain down your blights upon us!
				Casti.
					Sir, be calm.
				Duke.
					Sulphur and blistering fire. I want to die. 
					Unloose me here, here: I'm too tight.---Some one 
					Has tied my heart up; no, no; here, Sir, here. 
					All round my heart, and round my brain,---quick, quick--- 
					I'm burning.---Hush! a drug---a---
				Casti.
					Hold him up.
				Duke.
					Some dull---some potent drink. I'll give---I'll give 
					The world away for peace. Oh! round my heart, 
					And---Ah! unloose this cord about my throat. 
					Has no one mercy here? I am the Duke,--- 
					The Duke. Ha! I am---nothing.
				Casti.
					Raise his head. 
					Now, my dear lord,---
				Duke.
					O my poor son, my son! 
					Young victims---both so young,---so innocent. 
					But they are gone. I feel as I could sleep--- 
					Sleep---hush! for ever. My poor son!---
				Dies.
			EPILOGUE [By Unknown] (BY A FRIEND.) SPOKEN BY MISS
					FOOTE.
				
				Miss Foote
					Ladies!---Excuse me that I live---but I
					Implored the Poet not to let me die; 
					An author's fate, I urged, would do as well,--- 
					To be alive, and but insensible.
					No Epilogue is written, so you may guess 
					The Poet's and the Manager's distress:--- 
					I've seen much mingled fury and despair, 
					Stamping of feet, and tearing of the hair, 
					Lines penn'd and blotted out,---old verses read 
					To see what earlier Epilogues have said: 
					But not a couplet could their favour win,--- 
					The deepest Tragedy is there,---within. 
					I, by the Manager's entreaty press'd, 
					Come to implore your hearts for the distrest. 
					It is not very willingly I do't, 
					But Mr. Fawcett says, "They'll hear Miss Foote!" And will you
						hear her?---You have thought perchance 
					She scarceshouldspeak after so deep a trance;---
					But women love last words---the best of all. 
					Faintness and speech are not unnatural,--- 
					Meek Desdemona, as I've heard and read, 
					(True woman!) "spake, after long seemingdead!"
					Then may not I throw off my death-like grief, 
					And talk a little,---merely for relief? How like you this our
						play?---be candid---come--- 
					Say, is the Tragic Muse at all at home?--- 
					'Tis said large Theatres the Drama mar,--- 
					At least somelittle oneskeep up this war;
					But oh! I love the wondrous scene,---the dress,--- 
					The state, that lends to sorrow, mightiness. 
					Give me to see ennobled Tragedy 
					In proud magnificence go sweeping by--- 
					Her royal beauty deepen'd---and her grace 
					Made awful by fit circumstance and place! 
					No niggard stage becomes her gorgeous gloom; 
					Her soul, as King John says, wants elbow room. But I forget
						my duty to the play, 
					And custom disregard;---what shall I say?--- 
					Let me recal to mind some sterling rhyme 
					Of an "approved good master" of his time--- 
					"When Learning's triumphs o'er her barbarous foes 
					"First rear'd the stage"---a plague on't---I must close 
					This sombre task. I really cannot speak 
					The Epilogue---I'll learn one by next week. In the meantime,
						kind friends, allow our play 
					To live without it till another day.
