        Scene.---A Hall in the Royal Palace of Nineveh.
        
            ACT I.
            
                Scene I.
                ---A Hall in the Palace.
                
                     Salemenes 
                    solus
                    He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her
                        lord;
                    He hath wronged my sister---still he is my brother; 
                    He hath wronged his people---still he is their sovereign--- 
                    And I must be his friend as well as subject: 
                    He must not perish thus. I will not see 
                    The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis 
                    Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years 
                    Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale; 
                    He must be roused. In his effeminate heart 
                    There is a careless courage which Corruption 
                    Has not all quenched, and latent energies, 
                    Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--- 
                    Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness. 
                    If born a peasant, he had been a man 
                    To have reached an empire: to an empire born, 
                    He will bequeath none; nothing but a name, 
                    Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--- 
                    Yet---not all lost---even yet---he may redeem 
                    His sloth and shame, by only being that 
                    Which he should be, as easily as the thing 
                    He should not be and is. Were it less toil 
                    To sway his nations than consume his life? 
                    To head an army than to rule a harem? 
                    He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul, 
                    And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not 
                    Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--- 
                    He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound 
                    Sound of soft music heard from within.
                    To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--- 
                    The lyre---the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings 
                    Of lulling instruments, the softening voices 
                    Of women, and of beings less than women, 
                    Must chime in to the echo of his revel, 
                    While the great King of all we know of earth 
                    Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem 
                    Lies negligently by to be caught up 
                    By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it. 
                    Lo, where they come! already I perceive 
                    The reeking odours of the perfumed trains, 
                    And see the bright gems of the glittering girls, 
                    At once his Chorus and his Council, flash 
                    Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels, 
                    As femininely garbed, and scarce less female, 
                    The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--- 
                    He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him, 
                    And tell him what all good men tell each other, 
                    Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves 
                    Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.
                
            
            
                Scene II.
                Enter Sardanapalus effeminately dressed, his Head crowned
                    with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing, attended by a Train of Women and
                    young Slaves.
                 Sar. speaking to some of his
                        attendantsLet the pavilion over the Euphrates 
                    Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth 
                    For an especial banquet; at the hour 
                    Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting, 
                    And bid the galley be prepared. There is 
                    A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river: 
                    We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign 
                    To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus, 
                    We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour, 
                    When we shall gather like the stars above us, 
                    And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs; 
                    Till then, let each be mistress of her time, 
                    And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha, choose; Wilt thou along with
                        them or me?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    My Lord---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My Lord!---my Life! why answerest thou so coldly? 
                    It is the curse of kings to be so answered. 
                    Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine---say, wouldst thou 
                    Accompany our guests, or charm away 
                    The moments from me?
                
                
                    Myr.
                     The King's choice is mine.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy 
                    Is to contribute to thine every wish. 
                    I do not dare to breathe my own desire, 
                    Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still 
                    Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I would remain: I have no happiness 
                    Save in beholding thine; yet---
                
                Sar.
                    Yet! what
                    yet ? Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier 
                    Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I think the present is the wonted hour 
                    Of council; it were better I retire.
                    Sal. (comes forward and says) 
                    The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Who answers? How now, brother?
                
                Sal.
                      The Queen's brother, And your most faithful
                        vassal, royal Lord.
                
                
                     Sar. 
                    addressing his train
                    As I have said, let all dispose their hours 
                    Till midnight, when again we pray your presence. 
                    The court retiring.
                    To Myrrha, who is going.
                    Myrrha! I thought thou wouldst remain.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Great King, 
                    Thou didst not say so.
                
                Sar.
                    But
                    thou looked'st it: I know each glance of those Ionic eyes, 
                    Which said thou wouldst not leave me.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Sire! your brother---
                
                Sal.
                    His
                    Consort's brother, minion of Ionia! How darest
                    thou name me and not blush? 
                
                    Sar.
                     Not blush! 
                    Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson 
                    Like to the dying day on Caucasus, 
                    Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows, 
                    And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness, 
                    Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one, 
                    And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Curséd be he who caused those tears to flow!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Curse not thyself---millions do that already.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember 
                    I am a monarch.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Would thou couldst!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    My sovereign, 
                    I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Since it must be so, and this churl has checked 
                    Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect 
                    That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose 
                    An empire than thy presence. 
                
                 Exit Myrrha
                
                    Sal.
                     It may be, 
                    Thou wilt lose both---and both for ever!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Brother! 
                    I can at least command myself, who listen 
                    To language such as this: yet urge me not 
                    Beyond my easy nature.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    'Tis beyond 
                    That easy---far too easy---idle nature, 
                    Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee! 
                    Though 'twere against myself.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    By the god Baal! 
                    The man would make me tyrant.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    So thou art. 
                    Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that 
                    Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice, 
                    The weakness and the wickedness of luxury, 
                    The negligence, the apathy, the evils 
                    Of sensual sloth---produce ten thousand tyrants, 
                    Whose delegated cruelty surpasses 
                    The worst acts of one energetic master, 
                    However harsh and hard in his own bearing. 
                    The false and fond examples of thy lusts 
                    Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap 
                    In the same moment all thy pageant power 
                    And those who should sustain it; so that whether 
                    A foreign foe invade, or civil broil 
                    Distract within, both will alike prove fatal: 
                    The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer; 
                    The last they rather would assist than vanquish.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs; 
                    A natural love unto my infant nephews; 
                    Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly, 
                    In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line; 
                    Also, another thing thou knowest not.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What's that?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     To thee an unknown word.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yet speak it; 
                    I love to learn.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Virtue.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Not know the word! 
                    Never was word yet rung so in my ears--- 
                    Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet: 
                    I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    From whom?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen 
                    Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient, 
                    As thou hast often proved---speak out, what moves thee?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Thy peril.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Say on.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Thus, then: all the nations, 
                    For they are many, whom thy father left 
                    In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.
                
                Sar.
                    'Gainst
                    me!! What would the slaves? 
                
                    Sal.
                     A king.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And what 
                    Am I then?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     In their eyes a nothing; but 
                    In mine a man who might be something still.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    The railing drunkards! why, what would they have? 
                    Have they not peace and plenty?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Of the first 
                    More than is glorious; of the last, far less 
                    Than the King recks of.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Whose then is the crime, 
                    But the false satraps, who provide no better?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks 
                    Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs 
                    Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace, 
                    Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal! 
                    Who built up this vast empire, and wert made 
                    A God, or at the least shinest like a God 
                    Through the long centuries of thy renown, 
                    This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld 
                    As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero, 
                    Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril! 
                    For what? to furnish imposts for a revel, 
                    Or multiplied extortions for a minion.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I understand thee---thou wouldst have me go 
                    Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars 
                    Which the Chaldeans read---the restless slaves 
                    Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes, 
                    And lead them forth to glory.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Wherefore not? 
                    Semiramis---a woman only---led 
                    These our Assyrians to the solar shores 
                    Of Ganges.
                
                Sar.
                    'Tis most true. And
                    how returned?
                Sal.
                    Why, like a
                    man ---a hero; baffled, but Not vanquished. With but twenty
                        guards, she made 
                    Good her retreat to Bactria.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And how many 
                    Left she behind in India to the vultures?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Our annals say not.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Then I will say for them--- 
                    That she had better woven within her palace 
                    Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards 
                    Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens, 
                    And wolves, and men---the fiercer of the three, 
                    Her myriads of fond subjects. Is this Glory?
                    Then let me live in ignominy ever.
                
                Sal.
                    All warlike spirits have not the same fate. 
                    Semiramis, the glorious parent of 
                    A hundred kings, although she failed in India, 
                    Brought Persia---Media---Bactria---to the realm 
                    Which she once swayed---and thou
                    mightst sway. 
                Sar.
                     
                    I sway them--- She but subdued them.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    It may be ere long 
                    That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    There was a certain Bacchus, was there not? 
                    I've heard my Greek girls speak of such---they say 
                    He was a God, that is, a Grecian god, 
                    An idol foreign to Assyria's worship, 
                    Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind 
                    Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st 
                    That he is deemed a God for what he did.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And in his godship I will honour him--- 
                    Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    What means the King?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    To worship your new God 
                    And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.
                
                Enter Cupbearer.
                
                     Sar. 
                    addressing the Cupbearer
                    Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems, 
                    Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence, 
                    Fill full, and bear it quickly. 
                
                Exit Cupbearer.
                
                    Sal.
                     Is this moment 
                    A fitting one for the resumption of 
                    Thy yet unslept-off revels?
                
                Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine.
                
                     Sar. 
                    taking the cup from him
                     Noble kinsman, 
                    If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores 
                    And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus 
                    Conquered the whole of India, did he not?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Not so:---of all his conquests a few columns. 
                    Which may be his, and might be mine, if I 
                    Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are 
                    The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed, 
                    The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke. 
                    But here---here in this goblet is his title 
                    To immortality---the immortal grape 
                    From which he first expressed the soul, and gave 
                    To gladden that of man, as some atonement 
                    For the victorious mischiefs he had done. 
                    Had it not been for this, he would have been 
                    A mortal still in name as in his grave; 
                    And, like my ancestor Semiramis, 
                    A sort of semi-glorious human monster. 
                    Here's that which deified him---let it now 
                    Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother, 
                    Pledge me to the Greek God!
                
                
                    Sal.
                     For all thy realms 
                    I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero, 
                    That he shed blood by oceans; and no God, 
                    Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment, 
                    Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires 
                    The young, makes Weariness forget his toil, 
                    And Fear her danger; opens a new world 
                    When this, the present, palls. Well, then I pledge thee
                    And him as a true man, who did his utmost
                    In good or evil to surprise mankind. 
                
                Drinks.
                
                    Sal.
                    Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy, 
                    Being bought without a tear. But that is not 
                    My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me, 
                    Continue what thou pleasest.
                    To the Cupbearer.
                    Boy, retire.
                
                Exit Cupbearer.
                
                    Sal.
                    I would but have recalled thee from thy dream; 
                    Better by me awakened than rebellion.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext? 
                    I am the lawful King, descended from 
                    A race of Kings who knew no predecessors. 
                    What have I done to thee, or to the people, 
                    That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    But 
                    Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?
                
                Sal.Think! Thou hast wronged her! 
                
                    Sar.
                     Patience, Prince, and hear me. 
                    She has all power and splendour of her station, 
                    Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs, 
                    The homage and the appanage of sovereignty. 
                    I married her as monarchs wed---for state, 
                    And loved her as most husbands love their wives. 
                    If she or thou supposedst I could link me 
                    Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate, 
                    Ye knew nor me---nor monarchs---nor mankind.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains 
                    Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not 
                    Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord! 
                    Nor would she deign to accept divided passion 
                    With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves. 
                    The Queen is silent.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And why not her brother?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I only echo thee the voice of empires, 
                    Which he who long neglects not long will govern.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur 
                    Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them 
                    To dry into the desert's dust by myriads, 
                    Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges; 
                    Nor decimated them with savage laws, 
                    Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids, 
                    Or Babylonian walls.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Yet these are trophies 
                    More worthy of a people and their prince 
                    Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines, 
                    And lavished treasures, and contemnéd virtues.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Or for my trophies I have founded cities: 
                    There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built 
                    In one day---what could that blood-loving beldame, 
                    My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis, 
                    Do more, except destroy them?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     'Tis most true; 
                    I own thy merit in those founded cities, 
                    Built for a whim, recorded with a verse 
                    Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built, 
                    Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what 
                    Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule, 
                    But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record. 
                    Why, those few lines contain the history 
                    Of all things human: hear---"Sardanapalus, 
                    The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes, 
                    In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus. 
                    Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip."

                
                
                    Sal.
                    A worthy moral, and a wise inscription, 
                    For a king to put up before his subjects!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--- 
                    "Obey the king---contribute to his treasure--- 
                    Recruit his phalanx---spill your blood at bidding--- 
                    Fall down and worship, or get up and toil." 
                    Or thus---"Sardanapalus on this spot 
                    Slew fifty thousand of his enemies. 
                    These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy." 
                    I leave such things to conquerors; enough 
                    For me, if I can make my subjects feel 
                    The weight of human misery less, and glide 
                    Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license 
                    Which I deny to them. We all are men.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Thy Sires have been revered as Gods---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    In dust 
                    And death, where they are neither Gods nor men. 
                    Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods; 
                    At least they banqueted upon your Gods, 
                    And died for lack of farther nutriment. 
                    Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--- 
                    I feel a thousand mortal things about me, 
                    But nothing godlike,---unless it may be 
                    The thing which you condemn, a disposition 
                    To love and to be merciful, to pardon 
                    The follies of my species, and (that's human) 
                    To be indulgent to my own.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Alas! 
                    The doom of Nineveh is sealed.---Woe---woe 
                    To the unrivalled city!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What dost dread?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours 
                    The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee, 
                    And thine and mine; and in another day
                    What is shall be the past of Belus' race.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What must we dread?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Ambitious treachery, 
                    Which has environed thee with snares; but yet 
                    There is resource: empower me with thy signet 
                    To quell the machinations, and I lay 
                    The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    The heads---how many?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Must I stay to number 
                    When even thine own's in peril? Let me go; 
                    Give me thy signet---trust me with the rest.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I will trust no man with unlimited lives. 
                    When we take those from others, we nor know 
                    What we have taken, nor the thing we give.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That's a hard question---But I answer, Yes. 
                    Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they 
                    Whom thou suspectest?---Let them be arrested.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment 
                    Will send my answer through thy babbling troop 
                    Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace, 
                    Even to the city, and so baffle all.--- 
                    Trust me.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Thou knowest I have done so ever; 
                    Take thou the signet. 
                
                Gives the signet.
                
                    Sal.
                     I have one more request.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Name it.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     That thou this night forbear the banquet 
                    In the pavilion over the Euphrates.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters 
                    That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come, 
                    And do their worst: I shall not blench for them; 
                    Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet; 
                    Nor crown me with a single rose the less; 
                    Nor lose one joyous hour.---I fear them not.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and 
                    A sword of such a temper, and a bow, 
                    And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth: 
                    A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy. 
                    And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them, 
                    Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--- 
                    If need be, wilt thou wear them?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Will I not? 
                    Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves 
                    Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword 
                    Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks, 
                    Of whom our captives often sing, related 
                    The same of their chief hero, Hercules, 
                    Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest 
                    The populace of all the nations seize 
                    Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    They did not speak thus of thy fathers.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     No; 
                    They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat; 
                    And never changed their chains but for their armour: 
                    Now they have peace and pastime, and the license 
                    To revel and to rail; it irks me not. 
                    I would not give the smile of one fair girl 
                    For all the popular breath that e'er divided 
                    A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues 
                    Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding, 
                    That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread 
                    Their noisome clamour?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You have said they are men; 
                    As such their hearts are something.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    So my dogs' are; 
                    And better, as more faithful:---but, proceed; 
                    Thou hast my signet:---since they are tumultuous, 
                    Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till 
                    Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain, 
                    Given or received; we have enough within us, 
                    The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch, 
                    Not to add to each other's natural burthen 
                    Of mortal misery, but rather lessen, 
                    By mild reciprocal alleviation, 
                    The fatal penalties imposed on life: 
                    But this they know not, or they will not know. 
                    I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them: 
                    I made no wars, I added no new imposts, 
                    I interfered not with their civic lives, 
                    I let them pass their days as best might suit them, 
                    Passing my own as suited me.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Thou stopp'st 
                    Short of the duties of a king; and therefore 
                    They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    They lie.---Unhappily, I am unfit 
                    To be aught save a monarch; else for me 
                    The meanest Mede might be the king instead.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What mean'st thou!---'tis thy secret; thou desirest 
                    Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature. 
                    Take the fit steps; and, since necessity 
                    Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er 
                    Was man who more desired to rule in peace 
                    The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better 
                    They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes, 
                    "The Mighty Hunter!" I will turn these realms 
                    To one wide desert chase of brutes, who were,
                    But would no more, by their own choice, be human.
                    What they have found me, they belie; that which
                    They yet may find me---shall defy their wish 
                    To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Then thou at last canst feel?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Feel! who feels not 
                    Ingratitude?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I will not pause to answer 
                    With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy 
                    Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee, 
                    And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign, 
                    As powerful in thy realm. Farewell! 
                
                 Exit Salemenes
                
                     Sar. 
                    solus
                     Farewell! 
                    He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet, 
                    Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern 
                    As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve 
                    To feel a master. What may be the danger, 
                    I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it. 
                    Must I consume my life---this little life--- 
                    In guarding against all may make it less? 
                    It is not worth so much! It were to die 
                    Before my hour, to live in dread of death, 
                    Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me, 
                    Because they are near; and all who are remote, 
                    Because they are far. But if it should be so--- 
                    If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire, 
                    Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth? 
                    I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image; 
                    To die is no less natural than those 
                    Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed 
                    Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till 
                    My name became the synonyme of Death--- 
                    A terror and a trophy. But for this 
                    I feel no penitence; my life is love: 
                    If I must shed blood, it shall be by force. 
                    Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein 
                    Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin 
                    Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished 
                    On objects which could cost her sons a tear: 
                    If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not: 
                    If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not. 
                    Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres, 
                    And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap 
                    Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest 
                    Of discontents infecting the fair soil, 
                    Making a desert of fertility.--- 
                    I'll think no more.---Within there, ho!

                    King, she is here.
                
                Myrrha enters.
                
                     Sar. 
                    apart to Attendant
                     Away!
                    Addressing Myrrha.
                    Beautiful being!
                    Thou dost almost anticipate my heart; 
                    It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me 
                    Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle, 
                    Communicates between us, though unseen, 
                    In absence, and attracts us to each other.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    There doth.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     I know there doth, but not its name: 
                    What is it?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    In my native land a God, 
                    And in my heart a feeling like a God's, 
                    Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal; 
                    For what I feel is humble, and yet happy--- 
                    That is, it would be happy; but--- 
                
                [Myrrha pauses.
                
                    Sar.
                     There comes 
                    For ever something between us and what 
                    We deem our happiness: let me remove 
                    The barrier which that hesitating accent 
                    Proclaims to thine, and mine is sealed.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    My Lord!---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My Lord---my King---Sire---Sovereign; thus it is--- 
                    For ever thus, addressed with awe. I ne'er 
                    Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's 
                    Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons 
                    Have gorged themselves up to equality, 
                    Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement. 
                    Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names, 
                    Lord---King---Sire---Monarch---nay, time was I prized them; 
                    That is, I suffered them---from slaves and nobles; 
                    But when they falter from the lips I love, 
                    The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill 
                    Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood 
                    Of this my station, which represses feeling 
                    In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me 
                    Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara, 
                    And share a cottage on the Caucasus 
                    With thee---and wear no crowns but those of flowers.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Would that we could!
                
                Sar.
                    And dost
                    thou feel this?---Why?
                
                    Myr.
                    Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And that is---
                
                
                    Myr.
                    The true value of a heart; 
                    At least, a woman's.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I have proved a thousand--- 
                    A thousand, and a thousand.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Hearts?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I think so.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Not one! the time may come thou may'st.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     It will. 
                    Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--- 
                    Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus, 
                    Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--- 
                    But Salemenes hath declared my throne 
                    In peril.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    He did well.
                
                Sar.
                    And say'st
                    thou so? Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared 
                    Drive from our presence with his savage jeers, 
                    And made thee weep and blush?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I should do both 
                    More frequently, and he did well to call me 
                    Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril 
                    Peril to thee---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Aye, from dark plots and snares 
                    From Medes---and discontented troops and nations. 
                    I know not what---a labyrinth of things--- 
                    A maze of muttered threats and mysteries: 
                    Thou know'st the man---it is his usual custom. 
                    But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--- 
                    But of the midnight festival.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    'Tis time 
                    To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not 
                    Spurned his sage cautions?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What?---and dost thou fear?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Fear!---I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death? 
                    A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I love.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And do not I? I love thee far---far more 
                    Than either the brief life or the wide realm, 
                    Which, it may be, are menaced;---yet I blench not.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me; 
                    For he who loves another loves himself, 
                    Even for that other's sake. This is too rash: 
                    Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Lost!---why, who is the aspiring chief who dared 
                    Assume to win them?
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Who is he should dread 
                    To try so much? When he who is their ruler 
                    Forgets himself---will they remember him?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Myrrha!
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Frown not upon me: you have smiled 
                    Too often on me not to make those frowns 
                    Bitterer to bear than any punishment 
                    Which they may augur.---King, I am your subject! 
                    Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--- 
                    Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness, 
                    Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--- 
                    A slave, and hating fetters---an Ionian, 
                    And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more 
                    Degraded by that passion than by chains! 
                    Still I have loved you. If that love were strong 
                    Enough to overcome all former nature, 
                    Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?
                
                Sar.Save me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,
                        And what I seek of thee is love---not safety.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And without love where dwells security?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I speak of woman's love.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     The very first 
                    Of human life must spring from woman's breast, 
                    Your first small words are taught you from her lips, 
                    Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs 
                    Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing, 
                    When men have shrunk from the ignoble care 
                    Of watching the last hour of him who led them.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music: 
                    The very chorus of the tragic song 
                    I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime 
                    Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not---calm thee.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I weep not.---But I pray thee, do not speak 
                    About my fathers or their land.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yet oft 
                    Thou speakest of them.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    True---true: constant thought 
                    Will overflow in words unconsciously; 
                    But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.
                
                Sar.
                    Well, then, how wouldst thou
                    save me, as thou saidst? 
                
                    Myr.
                    By teaching thee to save thyself, and not 
                    Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all 
                    The rage of the worst war---the war of brethren.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors; 
                    I live in peace and pleasure: what can man 
                    Do more?
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Alas! my Lord, with common men 
                    There needs too oft the show of war to keep 
                    The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king, 
                    'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And I have never sought but for the last.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And now art neither.
                
                Sar.
                    Dost
                    thou say so, Myrrha?
                Myr.
                    I speak of civic popular love,
                    self -love, Which means that men are kept in awe and law, 
                    Yet not oppressed---at least they must not think so, 
                    Or, if they think so, deem it necessary, 
                    To ward off worse oppression, their own passions. 
                    A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel, 
                    And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Glory! what's that?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Ask of the Gods thy fathers.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them, 
                    'Tis for some small addition to the temple.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot. 
                    But what wouldst have? the Empire has been founded.
                    I cannot go on multiplying empires.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Preserve thine own.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    At least, I will enjoy it. 
                    Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates: 
                    The hour invites, the galley is prepared, 
                    And the pavilion, decked for our return, 
                    In fit adornment for the evening banquet, 
                    Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until 
                    It seems unto the stars which are above us 
                    Itself an opposite star; and we will sit 
                    Crowned with fresh flowers like---
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Victims.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No, like sovereigns, 
                    The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times, 
                    Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths, 
                    And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.
                
                Enter Pania
                
                    Pan.
                    May the King live for ever!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Not an hour 
                    Longer than he can love. How my soul hates 
                    This language, which makes life itself a lie, 
                    Flattering dust with eternity. Well, Pania! 
                    Be brief.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    I am charged by Salemenes to 
                    Reiterate his prayer unto the King, 
                    That for this day, at least, he will not quit 
                    The palace: when the General returns, 
                    He will adduce such reasons as will warrant 
                    His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon 
                    Of his presumption.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What! am I then cooped? 
                    Already captive? can I not even breathe 
                    The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes, 
                    Were all Assyria raging round the walls 
                    In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    I must obey, and yet---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Oh, Monarch, listen.--- 
                    How many a day and moon thou hast reclined 
                    Within these palace walls in silken dalliance, 
                    And never shown thee to thy people's longing; 
                    Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified, 
                    The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped, 
                    And all things in the anarchy of sloth, 
                    Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm! 
                    And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--- 
                    A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not 
                    Yield to the few still faithful a few hours, 
                    For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race, 
                    And for thy sons' inheritance?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    'Tis true! 
                    From the deep urgency with which the Prince 
                    Despatched me to your sacred presence, I 
                    Must dare to add my feeble voice to that 
                    Which now has spoken.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No, it must not be.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    For the sake of thy realm!
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Away!
                
                
                    Pan.
                    For that 
                    Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally 
                    Round thee and thine.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    These are mere fantasies: 
                    There is no peril:---'tis a sullen scheme 
                    Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal, 
                    And show himself more necessary to us.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Business to-morrow.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Aye---or death to-night.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Why let it come then unexpectedly, 
                    'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love; 
                    So let me fall like the plucked rose!---far better 
                    Thus than be withered.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Then thou wilt not yield, 
                    Even for the sake of all that ever stirred 
                    A monarch into action, to forego 
                    A trifling revel.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No.
                
                Myr.
                    Then yield for
                    mine ; For my sake!

                    Thine, my Myrrha!

                    'Tis the first 
                    Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted. 
                    Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence! 
                    Thou hear'st me.
                
                Pan.

                     I marvel at thee. 
                    What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Thy safety; and the certainty that nought 
                    Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require 
                    Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?
                
                Myr.
                    Because
                    thou dost not fear, I fear for thee . 
                
                    Sar.
                    To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    If the worst come, I shall be where none weep, 
                    And that is better than the power to smile. 
                    And thou?
                
                
                    Sar.
                     I shall be King, as heretofore.

                    Sar.
                     With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis, 
                    Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere. 
                    Fate made me what I am---may make me nothing--- 
                    But either that or nothing must I be: 
                    I will not live degraded.

                    Hadst thou felt 
                    Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.

                    Suspect!---that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose 
                    Ten thousand precious moments in vain words, 
                    And vainer fears. Within there!---ye slaves, deck 
                    The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel; 
                    If I must make a prison of our palace, 
                    At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly; 
                    If the Euphrates be forbid us, and 
                    The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border, 
                    Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!

                    Why do I love this man? My country's daughters 
                    Love none but heroes. But I have no country! 
                    The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him; 
                    And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--- 
                    To love whom we esteem not. Be it so: 
                    The hour is coming when he'll need all love, 
                    And find none. To fall from him now were baser 
                    Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest 
                    Would have been noble in my country's creed: 
                    I was not made for either. Could I save him,
                    I should not love him better, but myself;
                    And I have need of the last, for I have fallen 
                    In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger: 
                    And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving 
                    That he is hated of his own barbarians, 
                    The natural foes of all the blood of Greece. 
                    Could I but wake a single thought like those 
                    Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long 
                    'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart, 
                    He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph. 
                    He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves 
                    Her master, and would free him from his vices. 
                    If not, I have a means of freedom still, 
                    And if I cannot teach him how to reign, 
                    May show him how alone a King can leave 
                    His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.

                    The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly, 
                    Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire. 
                    How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds, 
                    Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain, 
                    Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise, 
                    I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray 
                    The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble 
                    For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest 
                    Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm! 
                    An earthquake should announce so great a fall--- 
                    A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk, 
                    To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon 
                    Its everlasting page the end of what 
                    Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun! 
                    The burning oracle of all that live, 
                    As fountain of all life, and symbol of 
                    Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit 
                    Thy lore unto calamity? Why not 
                    Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine 
                    All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart 
                    A beam of hope athwart the future years, 
                    As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me! 
                    I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--- 
                    I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall, 
                    And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams, 
                    When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched 
                    For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee, 
                    And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee, 
                    And asked of thee, and thou hast answered---but 
                    Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--- 
                    Is gone---and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge, 
                    To the delighted West, which revels in 
                    Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is 
                    Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset; 
                    And mortals may be happy to resemble 
                    The Gods but in decay.

                     Beleses, why 
                    So wrapt in thy devotions? Dost thou stand 
                    Gazing to trace thy disappearing God 
                    Into some realm of undiscovered day?

                    Gone.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Let it roll on---we are ready.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Yes. 
                    Would it were over!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Does the prophet doubt, 
                    To whom the very stars shine Victory?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I do not doubt of Victory---but the Victor.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     Well, let thy science settle that. Meantime 
                    I have prepared as many glittering spears 
                    As will out-sparkle our allies---your planets. 
                    There is no more to thwart us. The she-king, 
                    That less than woman, is even now upon 
                    The waters with his female mates. The order 
                    Is issued for the feast in the pavilion. 
                    The first cup which he drains will be the last 
                    Quaffed by the line of Nimrod.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    'Twas a brave one.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    And is a weak one---'tis worn out---we'll mend it.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Art sure of that?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Its founder was a hunter--- 
                    I am a soldier---what is there to fear?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    The soldier.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     And the priest, it may be: but 
                    If you thought thus, or think, why not retain 
                    Your king of concubines? why stir me up? 
                    Why spur me to this enterprise? your own 
                    No less than mine?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Look to the sky!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    I look.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    What seest thou?
                
                
                    Arb.
                     A fair summer's twilight, and 
                    The gathering of the stars.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     And midst them, mark 
                    Yon earliest, and the brightest, which so quivers, 
                    As it would quit its place in the blue ether.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Well?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    'Tis thy natal ruler---thy birth planet.
                
                
                     Arb. 
                    touching his scabbard
                    My star is in this scabbard: when it shines, 
                    It shall out-dazzle comets. Let us think 
                    Of what is to be done to justify 
                    Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer, 
                    They shall have temples---aye, and priests---and thou 
                    Shalt be the pontiff of---what Gods thou wilt; 
                    For I observe that they are ever just, 
                    And own the bravest for the most devout.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Aye, and the most devout for brave---thou hast not 
                    Seen me turn back from battle.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     No; I own thee 
                    As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain, 
                    As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now, 
                    Will it but please thee to forget the priest, 
                    And be the warrior?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Why not both?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    The better; 
                    And yet it almost shames me, we shall have 
                    So little to effect. This woman's warfare 
                    Degrades the very conqueror. To have plucked 
                    A bold and bloody despot from his throne, 
                    And grappled with him, clashing steel with steel, 
                    That were heroic or to win or fall; 
                    But to upraise my sword against this silkworm, 
                    And hear him whine, it may be---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Do not deem it: 
                    He has that in him which may make you strife yet; 
                    And were he all you think, his guards are hardy, 
                    And headed by the cool, stern Salemenes.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    They'll not resist.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Why not? they are soldiers.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    True, 
                    And therefore need a soldier to command them.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    That Salemenes is.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     But not their King. 
                    Besides, he hates the effeminate thing that governs, 
                    For the Queen's sake, his sister. Mark you not 
                    He keeps aloof from all the revels?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    But 
                    Not from the council---there he is ever constant.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    And ever thwarted: what would you have more 
                    To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning, 
                    His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:
                    Why, it is his revenge we work for.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Could 
                    He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    What, if we sound him?
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Yes---if the time served.
                
                Enter Balea.
                
                    Bal.
                    Satraps! The king commands your presence at 
                    The feast to-night.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    To hear is to obey. 
                    In the pavilion?
                
                
                    Bal.
                    No; here in the palace.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.
                
                
                    Bal.
                    It is so ordered now.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    And why?
                
                
                    Bal.
                    I know not. 
                    May I retire?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Stay.
                
                
                     Bel. 
                    to Arb. aside
                    Hush! let him go his way.
                    Alternately to Bal.
                    Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem
                    Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves 
                    Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from 
                    His royal table at the hour---was't midnight?
                
                
                    Bal.
                    It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords, 
                    I humble me before you, and depart. 
                
                 Exit Balea
                
                    Arb.
                    I like not this same sudden change of place; 
                    There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Doth he not change a thousand times a day? 
                    Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--- 
                    And moves more parasangs in its intents 
                    Than generals in their marches, when they seek 
                    To leave their foe at fault.---Why dost thou muse?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    He loved that gay pavilion,---it was ever 
                    His summer dotage.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    And he loved his Queen--- 
                    And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--- 
                    And he has loved all things by turns, except 
                    Wisdom and Glory.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Still---I like it not. 
                    If he has changed---why, so must we: the attack 
                    Were easy in the isolated bower, 
                    Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers; 
                    But in the hall of Nimrod---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Is it so? 
                    Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount 
                    A throne too easily---does it disappoint thee 
                    To find there is a slipperier step or two 
                    Than what was counted on?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    When the hour comes, 
                    Thou shalt perceive how far I fear or no. 
                    Thou hast seen my life at stake---and gaily played for: 
                    But here is more upon the die---a kingdom.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I have foretold already---thou wilt win it: 
                    Then on, and prosper.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     Now were I a soothsayer, 
                    I would have boded so much to myself. 
                    But be the stars obeyed---I cannot quarrel 
                    With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?
                
                Enter Salemenes
                
                    Sal.
                    Satraps!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    My Prince!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Well met---I sought ye both, 
                    But elsewhere than the palace.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Wherefore so?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    'Tis not the hour.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     The hour!---what hour?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Of midnight.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Midnight, my Lord!
                
                
                    Sal.
                     What, are you not invited?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Oh! yes---we had forgotten.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Is it usual 
                    Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Why---we but now received it.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Then why here?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    On duty.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     On what duty?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    On the state's. 
                    We have the privilege to approach the presence; 
                    But found the Monarch absent.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And I too 
                    Am upon duty.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    May we crave its purport?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!
                
                Enter Guards.
                
                    Sal.
                    continuing
                     Satraps, 
                    Your swords.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    delivering his
                     My lord, behold my scimitar.
                
                Arb. drawing his sword.
                    Take mine.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    advancing
                    I will.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    But in your heart the blade--- 
                    The hilt quits not this hand.
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    drawing
                    How! dost thou brave me? 
                    Tis well---this saves a trial, and false mercy. 
                    Soldiers, hew down the rebel!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Soldiers! Aye--- 
                    Alone you dare not.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Alone! foolish slave--- 
                    What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from 
                    Of open force? We dread thy treason, not 
                    Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--- 
                    The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down.
                
                
                     Bel. 
                    interposing
                    Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered 
                    My sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    No---I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of, 
                    And this slight arm, and die a king at least 
                    Of my own breath and body---so far that 
                    None else shall chain them.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    to the Guards.
                     You hear him and me.
                    Take him not,---kill.
                
                The Guards attack Arbaces, who defends himself valiantly and
                    dexterously till they waver.
                
                    Sal.
                     Is it even so; and must 
                    I do the hangman's office? Recreants! see 
                    How you should fell a traitor.
                
                Salemenes attacks Arbaces.
                Enter Sardanapalus and Train.
                
                    Sar.
                     Hold your hands--- 
                    Upon your lives, I say. What, deaf or drunken? 
                    My sword! O fool, I wear no sword: here, fellow, 
                    Give me thy weapon. 
                
                To a Guard.
                Sardanapalus snatches a sword from one of the soldiers, and
                    rushes between the combatants---they separate.
                
                    Sar.
                     In my very palace! 
                    What hinders me from cleaving you in twain, 
                    Audacious brawlers?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Sire, your justice.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Or--- 
                    Your weakness.
                
                
                     Sar. 
                    raising the sword
                    How?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Strike! so the blow's repeated 
                    Upon yon traitor---whom you spare a moment, 
                    I trust, for torture---I'm content.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What---him! 
                    Who dares assail Arbaces?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Indeed! 
                    Prince, you forget yourself, Upon what warrant?
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    showing the signet
                     Thine.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    confused.
                     The King's!
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Yes! and let the King confirm it.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I parted not from this for such a purpose.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You parted with it for your safety---I 
                    Employed it for the best. Pronounce in person. 
                    Here I am but your slave---a moment past 
                    I was your representative.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then sheathe 
                    Your swords.
                
                Arbaces and Salemenes return their swords
                    to the scabbards.
                
                    Sal.
                    Mine's sheathed: I pray you sheathe not yours:
                    'Tis the sole sceptre left you now with safety.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    A heavy one; the hilt, too, hurts my hand.
                    To a Guard.
                    Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,
                    What doth this mean?
                
                
                    Bel.
                    The Prince must answer that.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Treason---Arbaces! treachery and Beleses! 
                    That were an union I will not believe.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Where is the proof?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     I'll answer that, if once 
                    The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.
                
                
                     Arb. 
                    to Sal.
                    A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine 
                    Against his foes.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And now against his brother, 
                    And in an hour or so against himself.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That is not possible: he dared not; no--- 
                    No---I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings 
                    Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser 
                    Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives. 
                    You must have been deceived, my brother.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     First 
                    Let him deliver up his weapon, and 
                    Proclaim himself your subject by that duty, 
                    And I will answer all.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Why, if I thought so--- 
                    But no, it cannot be: the Mede Arbaces--- 
                    The trusty, rough, true soldier---the best captain 
                    Of all who discipline our nations---No, 
                    I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render 
                    The scimitar to me he never yielded 
                    Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon.
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    delivering back the signet
                    Monarch, take back your signet.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No, retain it; 
                    But use it with more moderation.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Sire, 
                    I used it for your honour, and restore it 
                    Because I cannot keep it with my own. 
                    Bestow it on Arbaces.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    So I should: 
                    He never asked it.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Doubt not, he will have it, 
                    Without that hollow semblance of respect.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince 
                    So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none 
                    Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou 
                    Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices 
                    Of the most dangerous orders of mankind. 
                    Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies 
                    For those who know thee not. Thy fellow's sin 
                    Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered 
                    By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Hear him, 
                    My liege---the son of Belus! he blasphemes 
                    The worship of the land, which bows the knee 
                    Before your fathers.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Oh! for that I pray you 
                    Let him have absolution. I dispense with 
                    The worship of dead men; feeling that I 
                    Am mortal, and believing that the race 
                    From whence I sprung are---what I see them---ashes.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars, 
                    And---
                
                Sar.
                     You shall join them ere they will rise, 
                    If you preach farther---Why,
                    this is rank treason.
                
                    Sal.
                    My lord!
                
                
                    Sar.
                     To school me in the worship of 
                    Assyria's idols! Let him be released--- 
                    Give him his sword.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    My Lord, and King, and Brother, 
                    I pray ye pause.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes, and be sermonised, 
                    And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal, 
                    And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Monarch! respect them.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Oh! for that---I love them; 
                    I love to watch them in the deep blue vault, 
                    And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes; 
                    I love to see their rays redoubled in 
                    The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave, 
                    As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad 
                    And rolling water, sighing through the sedges 
                    Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be 
                    Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods, 
                    As others hold, or simply lamps of night, 
                    Worlds---or the lights of Worlds---I know nor care not. 
                    There's something sweet in my uncertainty 
                    I would not change for your Chaldean lore; 
                    Besides, I know of these all clay can know 
                    Of aught above it, or below it---nothing. 
                    I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty--- 
                    When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.
                
                Bel.
                    For
                    neither , Sire, say better . 
                
                    Sar.
                     I will wait, 
                    If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge. 
                    In the mean time receive your sword, and know 
                    That I prefer your service militant 
                    Unto your ministry---not loving either.
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    aside
                    His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him, 
                    Spite of himself.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Please you to hear me, Satraps! 
                    And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee 
                    More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all 
                    Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part 
                    In peace---I'll not say pardon---which must be 
                    Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye, 
                    Although upon this breath of mine depends 
                    Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears. 
                    But fear not---for that I am soft, not fearful--- 
                    And so live on. Were I the thing some think me, 
                    Your heads would now be dripping the last drops 
                    Of their attainted gore from the high gates 
                    Of this our palace, into the dry dust, 
                    Their only portion of the coveted kingdom 
                    They would be crowned to reign o'er---let that pass. 
                    As I have said, I will not deem ye guilty,
                    Nor doom ye guiltless. Albeit better men
                    Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you; 
                    And should I leave your fate to sterner judges, 
                    And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice 
                    Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were 
                    Once honest. Ye are free, sirs.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Sire, this clemency---
                
                
                     Bel. 
                    interrupting him
                    Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent, 
                    We thank---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus; 
                    His offspring needs none.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    But being innocent---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Be silent.---Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal, 
                    Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    So we should be, were justice always done 
                    By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence 
                    Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That's a good sentence for a homily, 
                    Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it 
                    To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I trust there is no cause.
                
                Sar.
                    No
                    cause , perhaps; But many causers:---if ye meet with such 
                    In the exercise of your inquisitive function 
                    On earth, or should you read of it in heaven 
                    In some mysterious twinkle of the stars, 
                    Which are your chronicles, I pray you note, 
                    That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven 
                    Than him who ruleth many and slays none; 
                    And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows 
                    Enough to spare even those who would not spare him 
                    Were they once masters---but that's doubtful. Satraps! 
                    Your swords and persons are at liberty 
                    To use them as ye will---but from this hour 
                    I have no call for either. Salemenes! 
                    Follow me.
                Exeunt Sardanapalus, Salemenes, and the Train, etc., leaving
                        Arbaces and Beleses.
                
                    Arb.
                     Beleses!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Now, what think you?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    That we are lost.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     That we have won the kingdom.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    What? thus suspected---with the sword slung o'er us 
                    But by a single hair, and that still wavering, 
                    To be blown down by his imperious breath 
                    Which spared us---why, I know not.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Seek not why; 
                    But let us profit by the interval. 
                    The hour is still our own---our power the same--- 
                    The night the same we destined. He hath changed 
                    Nothing except our ignorance of all 
                    Suspicion into such a certainty 
                    As must make madness of delay.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    And yet---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    What, doubting still?
                
                
                    Arb.
                     He spared our lives, nay, more, 
                    Saved them from Salemenes.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    And how long 
                    Will he so spare? till the first drunken minute.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Or sober, rather. Yet he did it nobly; 
                    Gave royally what we had forfeited 
                    Basely---
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Say bravely.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Somewhat of both, perhaps--- 
                    But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide, 
                    I will no further on.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    And lose the world!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Lose any thing except my own esteem.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I blush that we should owe our lives to such 
                    A king of distaffs!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    But no less we owe them; 
                    And I should blush far more to take the grantor's!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt---the stars 
                    Have written otherwise.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     Though they came down, 
                    And marshalled me the way in all their brightness, 
                    I would not follow.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    This is weakness---worse 
                    Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead, 
                    And waking in the dark.---Go to---go to.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke, 
                    Even as the proud imperial statue stands 
                    Looking the monarch of the kings around it, 
                    And sways, while they but ornament, the temple.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    I told you that you had too much despised him, 
                    And that there was some royalty within him--- 
                    What then? he is the nobler foe.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    But we 
                    The meaner.---Would he had not spared us!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    So--- 
                    Wouldst thou be sacrificed thus readily?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    No---but it had been better to have died 
                    Than live ungrateful.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Oh, the souls of some men! 
                    Thou wouldst digest what some call treason, and 
                    Fools treachery---and, behold, upon the sudden, 
                    Because for something or for nothing, this 
                    Rash reveller steps, ostentatiously, 
                    'Twixt thee and Salemenes, thou art turned 
                    Into---what shall I say?---Sardanapalus! 
                    I know no name more ignominious.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    But 
                    An hour ago, who dared to term me such 
                    Had held his life but lightly---as it is, 
                    I must forgive you, even as he forgave us--- 
                    Semiramis herself would not have done it.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    No---the Queen liked no sharers of the kingdom, 
                    Not even a husband.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     I must serve him truly---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    And humbly?
                
                
                    Arb.
                     No, sir, proudly---being honest. 
                    I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven; 
                    And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty. 
                    You may do your own deeming---you have codes, 
                    And mysteries, and corollaries of 
                    Right and wrong, which I lack for my direction, 
                    And must pursue but what a plain heart teaches. 
                    And now you know me.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Have you finished?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Yes--- 
                    With you.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    And would, perhaps, betray as well 
                    As quit me?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    That's a sacerdotal thought, 
                    And not a soldier's.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Be it what you will--- 
                    Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     No--- 
                    There is more peril in your subtle spirit 
                    Than in a phalanx.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    If it must be so--- 
                    I'll on alone.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Alone!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Thrones hold but one.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    But this is filled.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     With worse than vacancy--- 
                    A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces: 
                    I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you; 
                    Was willing even to serve you, in the hope 
                    To serve and save Assyria. Heaven itself 
                    Seemed to consent, and all events were friendly, 
                    Even to the last, till that your spirit shrunk 
                    Into a shallow softness; but now, rather 
                    Than see my country languish, I will be 
                    Her saviour or the victim of her tyrant--- 
                    Or one or both---for sometimes both are one; 
                    And if I win---Arbaces is my servant.
                
                Arb.Your servant! 
                
                    Bel.
                     Why not? better than be slave,
                    The pardoned slave of she Sardanapalus!
                
                Enter Pania.
                
                    Pan.
                     My Lords, I bear an order from the king.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    It is obeyed ere spoken.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Notwithstanding, 
                    Let's hear it.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Forthwith, on this very night, 
                    Repair to your respective satrapies 
                    Of Babylon and Media.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    With our troops?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    My order is unto the Satraps and 
                    Their household train.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     But---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    It must be obeyed: 
                    Say, we depart.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    My order is to see you 
                    Depart, and not to bear your answer.
                
                
                     Bel. 
                    aside
                    Aye! 
                    Well, Sir---we will accompany you hence.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    I will retire to marshal forth the guard 
                    Of honour which befits your rank, and wait 
                    Your leisure, so that it the hour exceeds not.
                
                 Exit Pania
                
                    Bel.
                    Now then obey!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Doubtless.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Yes, to the gates 
                    That grate the palace, which is now our prison--- 
                    No further.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     Thou hast harped the truth indeed! 
                    The realm itself, in all its wide extension, 
                    Yawns. dungeons at each step for thee and me.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Graves!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    If I thought so, this good sword should dig 
                    One more than mine.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    It shall have work enough. 
                    Let me hope better than thou augurest; 
                    At present, let us hence as best we may. 
                    Thou dost agree with me in understanding 
                    This order as a sentence?
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Why, what other 
                    Interpretation should it bear? it is 
                    The very policy of Orient monarchs--- 
                    Pardon and poison---favours and a sword--- 
                    A distant voyage, and an eternal sleep. 
                    How many Satraps in his father's time---
                    For he I own is, or at least was, bloodless---
                
                Bel.
                    But
                    will not--- can not be so now. 
                
                    Arb.
                     I doubt it. 
                    How many Satraps have I seen set out 
                    In his Sire's day for mighty Vice-royalties, 
                    Whose tombs are on their path! I know not how, 
                    But they all sickened by the way, it was 
                    So long and heavy.
                
                
                    Bel.
                     Let us but regain 
                    The free air of the city, and we'll shorten 
                    The journey.
                
                
                    Arb.
                     'Twill be shortened at the gates, 
                    It may be.
                
                
                    Bel.
                    No; they hardly will risk that. 
                    They mean us to die privately, but not 
                    Within the palace or the city walls, 
                    Where we are known, and may have partisans: 
                    If they had meant to slay us here, we were 
                    No longer with the living. Let us hence.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    If I but thought he did not mean my life---
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Fool! hence---what else should despotism alarmed 
                    Mean? Let us but rejoin our troops, and march.
                
                
                    Arb.
                    Towards our provinces?
                
                
                    Bel.
                     No; towards your kingdom. 
                    There's time---there's heart, and hope, and power, and means--- 
                    Which their half measures leave us in full scope.--- 
                    Away!
                
                
                    Arb.
                    And I even yet repenting must 
                    Relapse to guilt!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    Self-defence is a virtue, 
                    Sole bulwark of all right. Away, I say! 
                    Let's leave this place, the air grows thick and choking, 
                    And the walls have a scent of night-shade---hence! 
                    Let us not leave them time for further council. 
                    Our quick departure proves our civic zeal; 
                    Our quick departure hinders our good escort, 
                    The worthy Pania, from anticipating 
                    The orders of some parasangs from hence: 
                    Nay, there's no other choice, but --- hence, I say.
                
                Exit with Arbaces, who follows reluctantly.
                Enter Sardanapalus and Salemenes.
                
                    Sar.
                    Well, all is remedied, and without bloodshed, 
                    That worst of mockeries of a remedy; 
                    We are now secure by these men's exile.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Yes, 
                    As he who treads on flowers is from the adder 
                    Twined round their roots.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Why, what wouldst have me do?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Undo what you have done.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Revoke my pardon?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Replace the crown now tottering on your temples.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That were tyrannical.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    But sure.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    We are so. 
                    What danger can they work upon the frontier?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    They are not there yet---never should they be so, 
                    Were I well listened to.
                
                Sar.
                      Nay, I have listened Impartially to thee---why not
                        to them?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You may know that hereafter; as it is, 
                    I take my leave to order forth the guard.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And you will join us at the banquet?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Sire, 
                    Dispense with me---I am no wassailer: 
                    Command me in all service save the Bacchant's.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Nay, but 'tis fit to revel now and then.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And fit that some should watch for those who revel 
                    Too oft. Am I permitted to depart?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes---Stay a moment, my good Salemenes, 
                    My brother---my best subject---better Prince 
                    Than I am King. You should have been the monarch, 
                    And I---I know not what, and care not; but 
                    Think not I am insensible to all 
                    Thine honest wisdom, and thy rough yet kind, 
                    Though oft-reproving sufferance of my follies. 
                    If I have spared these men against thy counsel, 
                    That is, their lives---it is not that I doubt 
                    The advice was sound; but, let them live: we will not 
                    Cavil about their lives---so let them mend them. 
                    Their banishment will leave me still sound sleep, 
                    Which their death had not left me.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Thus you run 
                    The risk to sleep for ever, to save traitors--- 
                    A moment's pang now changed for years of crime. 
                    Still let them be made quiet.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Tempt me not; 
                    My word is past.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     But it may be recalled.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Tis royal.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     And should therefore be decisive. 
                    This half-indulgence of an exile serves 
                    But to provoke---a pardon should be full, 
                    Or it is none.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And who persuaded me 
                    After I had repealed them, or at least 
                    Only dismissed them from our presence, who 
                    Urged me to send them to their satrapies?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    True; that I had forgotten; that is, Sire, 
                    If they e'er reached their Satrapies---why, then, 
                    Reprove me more for my advice.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And if 
                    They do not reach them---look to it!---in safety, 
                    In safety, mark me---and security--- 
                    Look to thine own.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Permit me to depart;
                    Their safety shall be cared for.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Get thee hence, then; 
                    And, prithee, think more gently of thy brother.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Sire, I shall ever duly serve my sovereign.
                
                 Exit Salemenes
                
                     Sar. 
                    solus
                    That man is of a temper too severe; 
                    Hard but as lofty as the rock, and free 
                    From all the taints of common earth---while I 
                    Am softer clay, impregnated with flowers: 
                    But as our mould is, must the produce be. 
                    If I have erred this time, 'tis on the side 
                    Where Error sits most lightly on that sense, 
                    I know not what to call it; but it reckons 
                    With me ofttimes for pain, and sometimes pleasure; 
                    A spirit which seems placed about my heart 
                    To count its throbs, not quicken them, and ask 
                    Questions which mortal never dared to ask me, 
                    Nor Baal, though an oracular deity--- 
                    Albeit his marble face majestical 
                    Frowns as the shadows of the evening dim 
                    His brows to changed expression, till at times 
                    I think the statue looks in act to speak. 
                    Away with these vain thoughts, I will be joyous--- 
                    And here comes Joy's true herald.
                
                Enter Myrrha.
                
                    Myr.
                     King! the sky 
                    Is overcast, and musters muttering thunder, 
                    In clouds that seem approaching fast, and show 
                    In forkéd flashes a commanding tempest. 
                    Will you then quit the palace?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Tempest, say'st thou?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Aye, my good lord.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     For my own part, I should be 
                    Not ill content to vary the smooth scene, 
                    And watch the warring elements; but this 
                    Would little suit the silken garments and 
                    Smooth faces of our festive friends. Say, Myrrha, 
                    Art thou of those who dread the roar of clouds?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    In my own country we respect their voices 
                    As auguries of Jove.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Jove!---aye, your Baal--- 
                    Ours also has a property in thunder, 
                    And ever and anon some falling bolt 
                    Proves his divinity,---and yet sometimes 
                    Strikes his own altars.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    That were a dread omen.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes---for the priests. Well, we will not go forth 
                    Beyond the palace walls to-night, but make 
                    Our feast within.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Now, Jove be praised! that he 
                    Hath heard the prayer thou wouldst not hear. The Gods 
                    Are kinder to thee than thou to thyself, 
                    And flash this storm between thee and thy foes, 
                    To shield thee from them.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Child, if there be peril, 
                    Methinks it is the same within these walls 
                    As on the river's brink.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Not so; these walls 
                    Are high and strong, and guarded. Treason has 
                    To penetrate through many a winding way, 
                    And massy portal; but in the pavilion 
                    There is no bulwark.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     No, nor in the palace, 
                    Nor in the fortress, nor upon the top 
                    Of cloud-fenced Caucasus, where the eagle sits 
                    Nested in pathless clefts, if treachery be: 
                    Even as the arrow finds the airy king, 
                    The steel will reach the earthly. But be calm; 
                    The men, or innocent or guilty, are 
                    Banished, and far upon their way.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    They live, then?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    So sanguinary?
                    Thou!
                
                
                    Myr.
                     I would not shrink 
                    From just infliction of due punishment 
                    On those who seek your life: were't otherwise, 
                    I should not merit mine. Besides, you heard 
                    The princely Salemenes.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    This is strange; 
                    The gentle and the austere are both against me, 
                    And urge me to revenge.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    'Tis a Greek virtue.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    But not a kingly one---I'll none on't; or 
                    If ever I indulge in't, it shall be 
                    With kings---my equals.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     These men sought to be so.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Myrrha, this is too feminine, and springs 
                    From fear---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     For you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No matter, still 'tis fear. 
                    I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath, 
                    Are timidly vindictive to a pitch 
                    Of perseverance, which I would not copy. 
                    I thought you were exempt from this, as from 
                    The childish helplessness of Asian women.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    My Lord, I am no boaster of my love, 
                    Nor of my attributes; I have shared your splendour, 
                    And will partake your fortunes. You may live 
                    To find one slave more true than subject myriads: 
                    But this the Gods avert! I am content 
                    To be beloved on trust for what I feel, 
                    Rather than prove it to you in your griefs, 
                    Which might not yield to any cares of mine.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Grief cannot come where perfect love exists, 
                    Except to heighten it, and vanish from 
                    That which it could not scare away. Let's in--- 
                    The hour approaches, and we must prepare 
                    To meet the invited guests who grace our feast.
                
                Exeunt.
            
        
        
            ACT III.
            
                Scene I.
                ---The Hall of the Palace illuminated---Sardanapalus and his
                    Guests at Table.---A storm without, and Thunder occasionally heard during the
                    Banquet.
                
                    Sar.
                    Fill full! why this is as it should be: here 
                    Is my true realm, amidst bright eyes and faces 
                    Happy as fair! Here sorrow cannot reach.
                
                
                    Zam.
                    Nor elsewhere---where the King is, pleasure sparkles.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Is not this better now than Nimrod's huntings, 
                    Or my wild Grandam's chase in search of kingdoms 
                    She could not keep when conquered?
                
                
                    Alt.
                    Mighty though 
                    They were, as all thy royal line have been, 
                    Yet none of those who went before have reached 
                    The acmé of Sardanapalus, who 
                    Has placed his joy in peace---the sole true glory.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And pleasure, good Altada, to which glory 
                    Is but the path. What is it that we seek? 
                    Enjoyment! We have cut the way short to it, 
                    And not gone tracking it through human ashes, 
                    Making a grave with every footstep.
                
                
                    Zam.
                     No; 
                    All hearts are happy, and all voices bless 
                    The King of peace---who holds a world in jubilee.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Art sure of that? I have heard otherwise; 
                    Some say that there be traitors.
                
                
                    Zam.
                     Traitors they 
                    Who dare to say so!---'Tis impossible. 
                    What cause?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What cause? true,---fill the goblet up; 
                    We will not think of them: there are none such, 
                    Or if there be, they are gone.
                
                
                    Alt.
                     Guests, to my pledge! 
                    Down on your knees, and drink a measure to 
                    The safety of the King---the monarch, say I? 
                    The God Sardanapalus!
                    Zames and the Guests kneel, and exclaim---
                     Mightier than
                    His father Baal, the God Sardanapalus!
                
                It thunders as they kneel; some start up in confusion.
                
                    Zam.
                    Why do you rise, my friends? in that strong peal 
                    His father gods consented.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Menaced, rather. 
                    King, wilt thou bear this mad impiety?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Impiety!---nay, if the sires who reigned 
                    Before me can be Gods, I'll not disgrace 
                    Their lineage. But arise, my pious friends; 
                    Hoard your devotion for the Thunderer there: 
                    I seek but to be loved, not worshipped.
                
                
                    Alt.
                     Both--- 
                    Both you must ever be by all true subjects.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Methinks the thunders still increase: it is 
                    An awful night.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Oh yes, for those who have 
                    No palace to protect their worshippers.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     That's true, my Myrrha; and could I convert 
                    My realm to one wide shelter for the wretched, 
                    I'd do it.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Thou'rt no God, then---not to be 
                    Able to work a will so good and general, 
                    As thy wish would imply.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And your Gods, then, 
                    Who can, and do not?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Do not speak of that, 
                    Lest we provoke them.

                    True---, they love not censure 
                    Better than mortals. Friends, a thought has struck me: 
                    Were there no temples, would there, think ye, be 
                    Air worshippers? that is, when it is angry, 
                    And pelting as even now.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    The Persian prays 
                    Upon his mountain.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes, when the Sun shines.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And I would ask if this your palace were 
                    Unroofed and desolate, how many flatterers 
                    Would lick the dust in which the King lay low?
                
                
                    Alt.
                    The fair Ionian is too sarcastic 
                    Upon a nation whom she knows not well; 
                    The Assyrians know no pleasure but their King's, 
                    And homage is their pride.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Nay, pardon, guests, 
                    The fair Greek's readiness of speech.
                
                Alt.
                     
                    Pardon! sire: We honour her of all things next to thee. 
                    Hark! what was that?
                
                
                    Zam.
                    That! nothing but the jar 
                    Of distant portals shaken by the wind.
                
                
                    Alt.
                    It sounded like the clash of---hark again!
                
                
                    Zam.
                    The big rain pattering on the roof.

                    No more. 
                    Myrrha, my love, hast thou thy shell in order? 
                    Sing me a song of Sappho; her, thou know'st, 
                    Who in thy country threw---
                
                Enter Pania, with his sword and garments bloody, and
                    disordered. The guests rise in confusion.
                
                    Pan.
                    to the Guards
                     Look to the portals; 
                    And with your best speed to the walls without. 
                    Your arms! To arms! The King's in danger. Monarch 
                    Excuse this haste,---'tis faith.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Speak on.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    It is 
                    As Salemenes feared; the faithless Satraps---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    You are wounded---give some wine. Take breath, good Pania.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    'Tis nothing---a mere flesh wound. I am worn 
                    More with my speed to warn my sovereign, 
                    Than hurt in his defence.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Well, Sir, the rebels?
                
                
                    Pan.
                     Soon as Arbaces and Beleses reached 
                    Their stations in the city, they refused 
                    To march; and on my attempt to use the power 
                    Which I was delegated with, they called 
                    Upon their troops, who rose in fierce defiance.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    All?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Too many.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Spare not of thy free speech, 
                    To spare mine ears---the truth.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    My own slight guard 
                    Were faithful, and what's left of it is still so.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And are these all the force still faithful?
                
                
                    Pan.
                     No--- 
                    The Bactrians, now led on by Salemenes, 
                    Who even then was on his way, still urged 
                    By strong suspicion of the Median chiefs, 
                    Are numerous, and make strong head against 
                    The rebels, fighting inch by inch, and forming 
                    An orb around the palace, where they mean 
                    To centre all their force, and save the King.
                    He hesitates.
                    I am charged to---
                
                
                    Myr.
                    'Tis no time for hesitation.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Prince Salemenes doth implore the King 
                    To arm himself, although but for a moment, 
                    And show himself unto the soldiers: his 
                    Sole presence in this instant might do more 
                    Than hosts can do in his behalf.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     What, ho! 
                    My armour there.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And wilt thou?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Will I not? 
                    Ho, there!---but seek not for the buckler: 'tis 
                    Too heavy:---a light cuirass and my sword. 
                    Where are the rebels?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Scarce a furlong's length 
                    From the outward wall the fiercest conflict rages.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then I may charge on horseback. Sfero, ho! 
                    Order my horse out.---There is space enough 
                    Even in our courts, and by the outer gate, 
                    To marshal half the horsemen of Arabia.
                
                 Exit Sfero for the armour.

                    Sar.
                    I ne'er doubted it.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    But now I know thee.

                    to his Attendant.
                     Bring down my spear too---
                    Where's Salemenes?
                
                
                    Pan.
                     Where a soldier should be, 
                    In the thick of the fight.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then hasten to him---Is 
                    The path still open, and communication 
                    Left 'twixt the palace and the phalanx?
                
                
                    Pan.
                     'Twas 
                    When I late left him, and I have no fear; 
                    Our troops were steady, and the phalanx formed.

                    Tell him to spare his person for the present, 
                    And that I will not spare my own---and say, 
                    I come.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    There's victory in the very word.

                    Is all in readiness in the armoury. 
                    See that the women are bestowed in safety 
                    In the remote apartments: let a guard 
                    Be set before them, with strict charge to quit 
                    The post but with their lives---command it, Zames. 
                    Altada, arm yourself, and return here; 
                    Your post is near our person.

                Enter Sfero and others with the King's Arms, etc.

                    arming himself
                    Give me the cuirass---so: my baldric; now 
                    My sword: I had forgot the helm---where is it? 
                    That's well---no, 'tis too heavy; you mistake, too--- 
                    It was not this I meant, but that which bears 
                    A diadem around it.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    Sire, I deemed 
                    That too conspicuous from the precious stones 
                    To risk your sacred brow beneath---and trust me, 
                    This is of better metal, though less rich.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     You deemed! Are you too turned a rebel? Fellow! 
                    Your part is to obey: return, and---no--- 
                    It is too late---I will go forth without it.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    At least, wear this.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Wear Caucasus! why, 'tis 
                    A mountain on my temples.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    Sire, the meanest 
                    Soldier goes not forth thus exposed to battle. 
                    All men will recognise you---for the storm 
                    Has ceased, and the moon breaks forth in her brightness.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I go forth to be recognised, and thus 
                    Shall be so sooner. Now---my spear! I'm armed. 
                    In going stops short, and turns to Sfero
                    Sfero---I had forgotten---bring the mirror.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    The mirror, Sire?
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Yes, sir, of polished brass, 
                    Brought from the spoils of India---but be speedy.
                
                 Exit Sfero.
                
                    Sar.
                    Myrrha, retire unto a place of safety. 
                    Why went you not forth with the other damsels?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Because my place is here.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And when I am gone---
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I follow.
                
                Sar.
                     
                    You! to battle?
                
                    Myr.
                    If it were so, 
                    'Twere not the first Greek girl had trod the path.
                    I will await here your return.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     The place 
                    Is spacious, and the first to be sought out, 
                    If they prevail; and, if it be so, 
                    And I return not---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Still we meet again.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    How?
                
                
                    Myr.
                     In the spot where all must meet at last--- 
                    In Hades! if there be, as I believe, 
                    A shore beyond the Styx; and if there be not, 
                    In ashes.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Darest thou so much?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I dare all things 
                    Except survive what I have loved, to be 
                    A rebel's booty: forth, and do your bravest.
                
                Re-enter Sfero with the mirror.
                
                    Sar.
                    looking at himself
                    This cuirass fits me well, the baldric better, 
                    And the helm not at all. Methinks I seem 
                    Flings away the helmet after trying it again.
                    Passing well in these toys; and now to prove them. 
                    Altada! Where's Altada?
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    Waiting, Sire, 
                    Without: he has your shield in readiness.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    True---I forgot---he is my shield-bearer 
                    By right of blood, derived from age to age. 
                    Myrrha, embrace me;---yet once more---once more--- 
                    Love me, whate'er betide. My chiefest glory 
                    Shall be to make me worthier of your love.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Go forth, and conquer!
                    Exeunt Sardanapalus and Sfero.
                     Now, I am alone:
                    All are gone forth, and of that all how few 
                    Perhaps return! Let him but vanquish, and 
                    Me perish! If he vanquish not, I perish; 
                    For I will not outlive him. He has wound 
                    About my heart, I know not how nor why. 
                    Not for that he is King; for now his kingdom 
                    Rocks underneath his throne, and the earth yawns 
                    To yield him no more of it than a grave; 
                    And yet I love him more. Oh, mighty Jove! 
                    Forgive this monstrous love for a barbarian, 
                    Who knows not of Olympus! yes, I love him 
                    Now---now---far more than---Hark---to the war shout! 
                    Methinks it nears me. If it should be so,
                    She draws forth a small vial.
                    This cunning Colchian poison, which my father 
                    Learned to compound on Euxine shores, and taught me 
                    How to preserve, shall free me! It had freed me 
                    Long ere this hour, but that I loved, until 
                    I half forgot I was a slave:---where all 
                    Are slaves save One, and proud of servitude, 
                    So they are served in turn by something lower 
                    In the degree of bondage: we forget 
                    That shackles worn like ornaments no less 
                    Are chains. Again that shout! and now the clash 
                    Of arms---and now---and now---
                
                Enter Altada.
                
                    Alt.
                     Ho, Sfero, ho!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    He is not here; what wouldst thou with him? How 
                    Goes on the conflict?
                
                
                    Alt.
                     Dubiously and fiercely.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And the King?
                
                
                    Alt.
                     Like a king. I must find Sfero, 
                    And bring him a new spear with his own helmet. 
                    He fights till now bare-headed, and by far 
                    Too much exposed. The soldiers knew his face, 
                    And the foe too; and in the moon's broad light, 
                    His silk tiara and his flowing hair 
                    Make him a mark too royal. Every arrow 
                    Is pointed at the fair hair and fair features, 
                    And the broad fillet which crowns both.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Ye Gods, 
                    Who fulminate o'er my father's land, protect him! 
                    Were you sent by the King?
                
                
                    Alt.
                    By Salemenes, 
                    Who sent me privily upon this charge, 
                    Without the knowledge of the careless sovereign. 
                    The King! the King fights as he revels! ho! 
                    What, Sfero! I will seek the armoury--- 
                    He must be there. 
                
                 Exit Altada
                
                    Myr.
                     'Tis no dishonour---no--- 
                    'Tis no dishonour to have loved this man. 
                    I almost wish now, what I never wished 
                    Before---that he were Grecian. If Alcides 
                    Were shamed in wearing Lydian Omphale's 
                    She-garb, and wielding her vile distaff; surely 
                    He, who springs up a Hercules at once, 
                    Nursed in effeminate arts from youth to manhood, 
                    And rushes from the banquet to the battle, 
                    As though it were a bed of love, deserves 
                    That a Greek girl should be his paramour, 
                    And a Greek bard his minstrel---a Greek tomb 
                    His monument. How goes the strife, sir?
                
                
                    Enter an Officer.
                
                
                    Officer.
                     Lost, 
                    Lost almost past recovery. Zames! Where 
                    Is Zames?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Posted with the guard appointed 
                    To watch before the apartment of the women.
                    Exit Officer.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    sola
                    He's gone; and told no more than that all's lost! 
                    What need have I to know more? In those words, 
                    Those little words, a kingdom and a king, 
                    A line of thirteen ages, and the lives 
                    Of thousands, and the fortune of all left 
                    With life, are merged; and I, too, with the great, 
                    Like a small bubble breaking with the wave 
                    Which bore it, shall be nothing. At the least, 
                    My fate is in my keeping: no proud victor 
                    Shall count me with his spoils.
                
                Enter Pania.
                
                    Pan.
                     Away with me, 
                    Myrrha, without delay; we must not lose 
                    A moment---all that's left us now.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    The King?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Sent me here to conduct you hence, beyond 
                    The river, by a secret passage.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Then 
                    He lives---
                
                
                    Pan.
                    And charged me to secure your life, 
                    And beg you to live on for his sake, till 
                    He can rejoin you.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Will he then give way?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Not till the last. Still, still he does whate'er 
                    Despair can do; and step by step disputes 
                    The very palace.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     They are here, then:---aye, 
                    Their shouts come ringing through the ancient halls, 
                    Never profaned by rebel echoes till 
                    This fatal night. Farewell, Assyria's line! 
                    Farewell to all of Nimrod! Even the name 
                    Is now no more.
                
                
                    Pan.
                    Away with me---away!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    No: I'll die here!---Away, and tell your King 
                    I loved him to the last.
                
                Enter Sardanapalus and Salemenes with
                    Soldiers. Pania quits Myrrha, and ranges
                    himself with them.
                
                    Sar.
                     Since it is thus, 
                    We'll die where we were born---in our own halls. 
                    Serry your ranks---stand firm. I have despatched 
                    A trusty satrap for the guard of Zames, 
                    All fresh and faithful; they'll be here anon. 
                    All is not over.---Pania, look to Myrrha.
                
                Pania returns towards Myrrha.
                
                    Sal.
                    We have breathing time; yet once more charge, my friends--- 
                    One for Assyria!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Rather say for Bactria! 
                    My faithful Bactrians, I will henceforth be 
                    King of your nation, and we'll hold together 
                    This realm as province.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Hark! they come---they come.
                
                Enter Beleses and Arbaces with the
                    Rebels.
                
                    Arb.
                    Set on, we have them in the toil. Charge! charge!
                
                
                    Bel.
                    On! on!---Heaven fights for us, and with us---On!
                    They charge the King and Salemenes with their troops,
                        who defend themselves till the arrival of Zames with the
                        Guard before mentioned. The Rebels are then driven off, and pursued by
                            Salemenes, etc. As the King is going to join the
                        pursuit, Beleses crosses him.
                    
                        Bel.
                        Ho! tyrant---I will end this war.
                    
                    
                        Sar.
                        Even so, 
                        My warlike priest, and precious prophet, and 
                        Grateful and trusty subject: yield, I pray thee. 
                        I would reserve thee for a fitter doom, 
                        Rather than dip my hands in holy blood.
                    
                    
                        Bel.
                        Thine hour is come.
                    
                    
                        Sar.
                         No, thine.---I've lately read, 
                        Though but a young astrologer, the stars; 
                        And ranging round the zodiac, found thy fate 
                        In the sign of the Scorpion, which proclaims 
                        That thou wilt now be crushed.
                    
                    
                        Bel.
                        But not by thee.
                    
                     They fight; Beleses is wounded and disarmed.
                
                    Sar.
                    raising his sword to despatch him, exclaims
                    ---Now call upon thy planets, will they shoot 
                    From the sky to preserve their seer and credit? 
                    A party of Rebels enter and rescue Beleses. They assail
                        the King, who in turn, is rescued by a Party of his Soldiers, who drive the
                        Rebels off.
                    The villain was a prophet after all. 
                    Upon them---ho! there---victory is ours.
                
                Exit in pursuit.
                
                     Myr. 
                    to Pan.
                    Pursue! Why stand'st thou here, and leavest the ranks 
                    Of fellow-soldiers conquering without thee?
                
                
                    Pan.
                    The King's command was not to quit thee.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     
                    Me!
                    Think not of me---a single soldier's arm 
                    Must not be wanting now. I ask no guard, 
                    I need no guard: what, with a world at stake, 
                    Keep watch upon a woman? Hence, I say, 
                    Or thou art shamed! Nay, then, I will go forth,
                    A feeble female, 'midst their desperate strife,
                    And bid thee guard me there---where thou shouldst shield
                    Thy sovereign. 
                
                 Exit Myrrha
                
                    Pan.
                     Yet stay, damsel!---She's gone. 
                    If aught of ill betide her, better I 
                    Had lost my life. Sardanapalus holds her 
                    Far dearer than his kingdom, yet he fights 
                    For that too; and can I do less than he, 
                    Who never flashed a scimitar till now? 
                    Myrrha, return, and I obey you, though 
                    In disobedience to the monarch. 
                
                 Exit Pania Enter Altada and
                        Sfero by an opposite door.
                
                    Alt.
                     Myrrha! 
                    What, gone? yet she was here when the fight raged, 
                    And Pania also. Can aught have befallen them?
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    I saw both safe, when late the rebels fled; 
                    They probably are but retired to make 
                    Their way back to the harem.
                
                
                    Alt.
                     If the King 
                    Prove victor, as it seems even now he must, 
                    And miss his own Ionian, we are doomed 
                    To worse than captive rebels.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                    Let us trace them: 
                    She cannot be fled far; and, found, she makes 
                    A richer prize to our soft sovereign 
                    Than his recovered kingdom.
                
                
                    Alt.
                    Baal himself 
                    Ne'er fought more fiercely to win empire, than 
                    His silken son to save it: he defies 
                    All augury of foes or friends; and like 
                    The close and sultry summer's day, which bodes 
                    A twilight tempest, bursts forth in such thunder 
                    As sweeps the air and deluges the earth. 
                    The man's inscrutable.
                
                
                    Sfe.
                     Not more than others. 
                    All are the sons of circumstance: away--- 
                    Let's seek the slave out, or prepare to be 
                    Tortured for his infatuation, and 
                    Condemned without a crime. 
                
                Exeunt.
                Enter Salemenes and Soldiers, etc.
                
                    Sal.
                     The triumph is 
                    Flattering: they are beaten backward from the palace, 
                    And we have opened regular access 
                    To the troops stationed on the other side 
                    Euphrates, who may still be true; nay, must be, 
                    When they hear of our victory. But where 
                    Is the chief victor? where's the King?
                
                Enter Sardanapalus, cum suis, etc., and
                        Myrrha.
                
                    Sar.
                     Here, brother.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Unhurt, I hope.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Not quite; but let it pass. 
                    We've cleared the palace---
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And I trust the city. 
                    Our numbers gather; and I've ordered onward 
                    A cloud of Parthians, hitherto reserved, 
                    All fresh and fiery, to be poured upon them 
                    In their retreat, which soon will be a flight.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    It is already, or at least they marched 
                    Faster than I could follow with my Bactrians, 
                    Who spared no speed. I am spent: give me a seat.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    There stands the throne, Sire.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     'Tis no place to rest on, 
                    For mind nor body: let me have a couch, 
                    They place a seat.
                    A peasant's stool, I care not what: so---now
                    I breathe more freely.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    This great hour has proved 
                    The brightest and most glorious of your life.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And the most tiresome. Where's my cupbearer? 
                    Bring me some water.
                
                Sal.
                    smiling.  'Tis the first time he
                    Ever had such an order: even I, 
                    Your most austere of counsellors, would now 
                    Suggest a purpler beverage.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Blood---doubtless. 
                    But there's enough of that shed; as for wine, 
                    I have learned to-night the price of the pure element: 
                    Thrice have I drank of it, and thrice renewed, 
                    With greater strength than the grape ever gave me, 
                    My charge upon the rebels. Where's the soldier 
                    Who gave me water in his helmet?
                
                
                    One of the Guards.
                    Slain, Sire! 
                    An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering 
                    The last drops from his helm, he stood in act 
                    To place it on his brows.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Slain! unrewarded! 
                    And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave! 
                    Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with 
                    Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay 
                    The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched 
                    As I am now. 
                    They bring water---he drinks.
                    I live again---from henceforth
                    The goblet I reserve for hours of love, 
                    But war on water.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And that bandage, Sire, 
                    Which girds your arm?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    A scratch from brave Beleses.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Oh! he is wounded!
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Not too much of that; 
                    And yet it feels a little stiff and painful, 
                    Now I am cooler.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    You have bound it with---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    The fillet of my diadem: the first time 
                    That ornament was ever aught to me, 
                    Save an incumbrance.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    to the Attendants.
                     Summon speedily
                    A leech of the most skilful: pray, retire: 
                    I will unbind your wound and tend it.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Do so, 
                    For now it throbs sufficiently: but what 
                    Know'st thou of wounds? yet wherefore do I ask? 
                    Know'st thou, my brother, where I lighted on 
                    This minion?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Herding with the other females, 
                    Like frightened antelopes.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No: like the dam 
                    Of the young lion, femininely raging 
                    (And femininely meaneth furiously, 
                    Because all passions in excess are female,) 
                    Against the hunter flying with her cub, 
                    She urged on with her voice and gesture, and 
                    Her floating hair and flashing eyes, the soldiers, 
                    In the pursuit.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Indeed!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    You see, this night 
                    Made warriors of more than me. I paused 
                    To look upon her, and her kindled cheek; 
                    Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair 
                    As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose 
                    Along her most transparent brow; her nostril 
                    Dilated from its symmetry; her lips 
                    Apart; her voice that clove through all the din, 
                    As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash, 
                    Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her 
                    Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness 
                    Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up 
                    From a dead soldier's grasp;---all these things made 
                    Her seem unto the troops a prophetess 
                    Of victory, or Victory herself, 
                    Come down to hail us hers.
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    aside
                    This is too much. 
                    Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost, 
                    Unless we turn his thoughts.
                    Aloud.
                    But pray thee, Sire,
                    Think of your wound---you said even now 'twas painful.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That's true, too; but I must not think of it.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I have looked to all things needful, and will now 
                    Receive reports of progress made in such 
                    Orders as I had given, and then return 
                    To hear your further pleasure.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Be it so.
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    in retiring
                    Myrrha!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Prince!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You have shown a soul to-night, 
                    Which, were he not my sister's lord--- But now 
                    I have no time: thou lovest the King?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I love 
                    Sardanapalus.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    But wouldst have him King still?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I would not have him less than what he should be.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all 
                    He should, or should not be; to have him live,
                    Let him not sink back into luxury. 
                    You have more power upon his spirit than 
                    Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion 
                    Raging without: look well that he relapse not.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    There needed not the voice of Salemenes 
                    To urge me on to this: I will not fail. 
                    All that a woman's weakness can---
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Is power 
                    Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his: 
                    Exert it wisely. 
                
                 Exit Salemenes
                
                    Sar.
                     Myrrha! what, at whispers 
                    With my stern brother? I shall soon be jealous.
                
                
                     Myr. 
                    smiling
                    You have cause, Sire; for on the earth there breathes not 
                    A man more worthy of a woman's love, 
                    A soldier's trust, a subject's reverence, 
                    A king's esteem---the whole world's admiration!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Praise him, but not so warmly. I must not 
                    Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught 
                    That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And now retire, to have your wound looked to, 
                    Pray lean on me.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes, love! but not from pain.
                
                Exeunt omnes.
            
        
        
            ACT IV.
            
                Scene I.
                Sardanapalus discovered sleeping upon a Couch, and
                    occasionally disturbed in his slumbers, with Myrrha
                    watching.
                
                     Myr. 
                    sola, gazing
                    I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be, 
                    Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him? 
                    No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet! 
                    Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams, 
                    Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed, 
                    Look like thy brother, Death,---so still, so stirless--- 
                    For then we are happiest, as it may be, we 
                    Are happiest of all within the realm 
                    Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin. 
                    Again he moves---again the play of pain 
                    Shoots o'er his features, as the sudden gust 
                    Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm 
                    Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast 
                    Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling 
                    Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs. 
                    I must awake him---yet not yet; who knows 
                    From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if 
                    I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever 
                    Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of 
                    His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake 
                    Me more to see than him to suffer. No: 
                    Let Nature use her own maternal means, 
                    And I await to second, not disturb her.
                
                
                     Sar. 
                    awakening
                    Not so---although he multiplied the stars,
                    And gave them to me as a realm to share 
                    From you and with you! I would not so purchase 
                    The empire of Eternity. Hence---hence--- 
                    Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye, 
                    Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes! 
                    Once bloody mortals---and now bloodier idols, 
                    If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame! 
                    Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on 
                    The carcasses of Inde---away! away! 
                    Where am I? Where the spectres? Where---No---that 
                    Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst 
                    All that the dead dare gloomily raise up 
                    From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops 
                    Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--- 
                    Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world, 
                    And thou art lord of this. Be of good cheer; 
                    All will go well.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Thy hand---so---'tis thy hand;
                    'Tis flesh; grasp---clasp---yet closer, till I feel 
                    Myself that which I was.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    At least know me 
                    For what I am, and ever must be---thine.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I know it now. I know this life again. 
                    Ah, Myrrha! I have been where we shall be.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     My lord!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I've been i' the grave---where worms are lords 
                    And kings are---But I did not deem it so; 
                    I thought 'twas nothing.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    So it is; except 
                    Unto the timid, who anticipate 
                    That which may never be.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Oh, Myrrha! if 
                    Sleep shows such things, what may not Death disclose?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I know no evil Death can show, which Life 
                    Has not already shown to those who live 
                    Embodied longest. If there be indeed 
                    A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind 
                    All unincorporate: or if there flits 
                    A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay, 
                    Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven, 
                    And fetters us to earth---at least the phantom, 
                    Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I fear it not; but I have felt---have seen--- 
                    A legion of the dead.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And so have I. 
                    The dust we tread upon was once alive, 
                    And wretched. But proceed: what hast thou seen? 
                    Speak it, 'twill lighten thy dimmed mind.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Methought---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Yet pause, thou art tired---in pain---exhausted; all 
                    Which can impair both strength and spirit: seek 
                    Rather to sleep again.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Not now---I would not 
                    Dream; though I know it now to be a dream 
                    What I have dreamt:---and canst thou bear to hear it?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I can bear all things, dreams of life or death, 
                    Which I participate with you in semblance 
                    Or full reality.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And this looked real, 
                    I tell you: after that these eyes were open, 
                    I saw them in their flight---for then they fled.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Say on.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     I saw, that is, I dreamed myself 
                    Here---here---even where we are, guests as we were, 
                    Myself a host that deemed himself but guest, 
                    Willing to equal all in social freedom; 
                    But, on my right hand and my left, instead 
                    Of thee and Zames, and our customed meeting, 
                    Was ranged on my left hand a haughty, dark, 
                    And deadly face; I could not recognise it, 
                    Yet I had seen it, though I knew not where: 
                    The features were a Giant's, and the eye 
                    Was still, yet lighted; his long locks curled down 
                    On his vast bust, whence a huge quiver rose 
                    With shaft-heads feathered from the eagle's wing, 
                    That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair. 
                    I invited him to fill the cup which stood 
                    Between us, but he answered not; I filled it; 
                    He took it not, but stared upon me, till 
                    I trembled at the fixed glare of his eye: 
                    I frowned upon him as a king should frown; 
                    He frowned not in his turn, but looked upon me 
                    With the same aspect, which appalled me more, 
                    Because it changed not; and I turned for refuge 
                    To milder guests, and sought them on the right, 
                    Where thou wert wont to be. But---
                
                He pauses.
                
                    Myr.
                     What instead?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    In thy own chair---thy own place in the banquet--- 
                    I sought thy sweet face in the circle---but 
                    Instead---a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed, 
                    And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing, 
                    Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow, 
                    Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion 
                    Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust, 
                    Sate:---my veins curdled.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Is this all?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Upon 
                    Her right hand---her lank, bird-like, right hand---stood 
                    A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on 
                    Her left, another, filled with---what I saw not, 
                    But turned from it and her. But all along 
                    The table sate a range of crownéd wretches, 
                    Of various aspects, but of one expression.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And felt you not this a mere vision?
                
                
                    Sar.
                     No: 
                    It was so palpable, I could have touched them. 
                    I turned from one face to another, in 
                    The hope to find at last one which I knew 
                    Ere I saw theirs: but no---all turned upon me, 
                    And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared, 
                    Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be, 
                    Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them, 
                    And life in me: there was a horrid kind 
                    Of sympathy between us, as if they 
                    Had lost a part of death to come to me, 
                    And I the half of life to sit by them. 
                    We were in an existence all apart 
                    From heaven or earth---And rather let me see 
                    Death all than such a being!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And the end?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose 
                    The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--- 
                    Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of 
                    The Hunter smiled upon me---I should say, 
                    His lips, for his eyes moved not---and the woman's 
                    Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile. 
                    Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand 
                    Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--- 
                    Mere mimics even in death---but I sate still: 
                    A desperate courage crept through every limb, 
                    And at the last I feared them not, but laughed 
                    Full in their phantom faces. But then---then 
                    The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it, 
                    And grasped it---but it melted from my own; 
                    While he too vanished, and left nothing but 
                    The memory of a hero, for he looked so.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And was: the ancestor of heroes, too, 
                    And thine no less.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Aye, Myrrha, but the woman, 
                    The female who remained, she flew upon me, 
                    And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses; 
                    And, flinging down the goblets on each hand, 
                    Methought their poisons flowed around us, till 
                    Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung; 
                    The other phantoms, like a row of statues, 
                    Stood dull as in our temples, but she still 
                    Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if, 
                    In lieu of her remote descendant, I 
                    Had been the son who slew her for her incest. 
                    Then---then---a chaos of all loathsome things 
                    Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--- 
                    Buried, and raised again---consumed by worms, 
                    Purged by the flames, and withered in the air! 
                    I can fix nothing further of my thoughts, 
                    Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee, 
                    In all these agonies,---and woke and found thee.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    So shalt thou find me ever at thy side, 
                    Here and hereafter, if the last may be. 
                    But think not of these things---the mere creations 
                    Of late events, acting upon a frame 
                    Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--- 
                    Such as might try the sternest.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     I am better.
                    Now that I see thee once more, what was seen
                    Seems nothing.
                
                Enter Salemenes
                
                    Sal.
                     Is the king so soon awake?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept; 
                    For all the predecessors of our line 
                    Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them. 
                    My father was amongst them, too; but he, 
                    I know not why, kept from me, leaving me 
                    Between the hunter-founder of our race, 
                    And her, the homicide and husband-killer, 
                    Whom you call glorious.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     So I term you also, 
                    Now you have shown a spirit like to hers. 
                    By day-break I propose that we set forth, 
                    And charge once more the rebel crew, who still 
                    Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    How wears the night?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     There yet remain some hours 
                    Of darkness: use them for your further rest.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought 
                    I passed hours in that vision.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Scarcely one; 
                    I watched by you: it was a heavy hour, 
                    But an hour only.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Let us then hold council; 
                    To-morrow we set forth.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    But ere that time, 
                    I had a grace to seek.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Tis granted.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Hear it 
                    Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis
                    For your ear only.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Prince, I take my leave.
                
                 Exit Myrrha.
                
                    Sal.
                    That slave deserves her freedom.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Freedom only! 
                    That slave deserves to share a throne.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Your patience--- 
                    'Tis not yet vacant, and 'tis of its partner 
                    I come to speak with you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     How! of the Queen?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Even so. I judged it fitting for their safety, 
                    That, ere the dawn, she sets forth with her children 
                    For Paphlagonia, where our kinsman Cotta 
                    Governs; and there, at all events, secure 
                    My nephews and your sons their lives, and with them 
                    Their just pretensions to the crown in case---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I perish---as is probable: well thought--- 
                    Let them set forth with a sure escort.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    That 
                    Is all provided, and the galley ready 
                    To drop down the Euphrates; but ere they 
                    Depart, will you not see---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My sons? It may 
                    Unman my heart, and the poor boys will weep; 
                    And what can I reply to comfort them, 
                    Save with some hollow hopes, and ill-worn smiles? 
                    You know I cannot feign.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    But you can feel! 
                    At least, I trust so: in a word, the Queen 
                    Requests to see you ere you part---for ever.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Unto what end? what purpose? I will grant 
                    Aught---all that she can ask---but such a meeting.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You know, or ought to know, enough of women, 
                    Since you have studied them so steadily, 
                    That what they ask in aught that touches on 
                    The heart, is dearer to their feelings or 
                    Their fancy, than the whole external world. 
                    I think as you do of my sister's wish; 
                    But 'twas her wish---she is my sister---you 
                    Her husband---will you grant it?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Twill be useless: 
                    But let her come.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    I go. 
                
                 Exit Salemenes
                
                    Sar.
                     We have lived asunder
                    Too long to meet again---and now to meet!
                    Have I not cares enow, and pangs enow, 
                    To bear alone, that we must mingle sorrows, 
                    Who have ceased to mingle love?
                
                Re-enter Salemenes and Zarina.
                
                    Sal.
                     My sister! Courage: 
                    Shame not our blood with trembling, but remember 
                    From whence we sprung. The Queen is present, Sire.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    I pray thee, brother, leave me.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Since you ask it.
                
                 Exit Salemenes.
                
                    Zar.
                    Alone with him! How many a year has passed, 
                    Though we are still so young, since we have met, 
                    Which I have worn in widowhood of heart. 
                    He loved me not: yet he seems little changed--- 
                    Changed to me only---would the change were mutual! 
                    He speaks not---scarce regards me---not a word, 
                    Nor look---yet he was soft of voice and aspect,
                    Indifferent, not austere. My Lord!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Zarina!
                
                Zar.
                    No,
                    not Zarina---do not say Zarina. That tone---That
                        word---annihilate long years, 
                    And things which make them longer.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     'Tis too late 
                    To think of these past dreams. Let's not reproach--- 
                    That is, reproach me not---for the last time---
                
                
                    Zar.
                    And first. I ne'er reproached you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     'Tis most true; 
                    And that reproof comes heavier on my heart 
                    Than---But our hearts are not in our own power.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Nor hands; but I gave both.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Your brother said 
                    It was your will to see me, ere you went 
                    From Nineveh with---
                
                He hesitates.
                
                    Zar.
                     Our children: it is true. 
                    I wish to thank you that you have not divided 
                    My heart from all that's left it now to love--- 
                    Those who are yours and mine, who look like you, 
                    And look upon me as you looked upon me 
                    Once---but they have not changed.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Nor ever will. 
                    I fain would have them dutiful.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    I cherish 
                    Those infants, not alone from the blind love 
                    Of a fond mother, but as a fond woman. 
                    They are now the only tie between us.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Deem not 
                    I have not done you justice: rather make them 
                    Resemble your own line than their own Sire. 
                    I trust them with you---to you: fit them for 
                    A throne, or, if that be denied---You have heard 
                    Of this night's tumults?
                
                
                    Zar.
                    I had half forgotten, 
                    And could have welcomed any grief save yours, 
                    Which gave me to behold your face again.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    The throne---I say it not in fear---but 'tis 
                    In peril: they perhaps may never mount it; 
                    But let them not for this lose sight of it. 
                    I will dare all things to bequeath it them; 
                    But if I fail, then they must win it back 
                    Bravely---and, won, wear it wisely, not as I 
                    Have wasted down my royalty.
                
                
                    Zar.
                     They ne'er 
                    Shall know from me of aught but what may honour 
                    Their father's memory.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Rather let them hear 
                    The truth from you than from a trampling world. 
                    If they be in adversity, they'll learn 
                    Too soon the scorn of crowds for crownless Princes, 
                    And find that all their father's sins are theirs. 
                    My boys!---I could have borne it were I childless.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Oh! do not say so---do not poison all 
                    My peace left, by unwishing that thou wert 
                    A father. If thou conquerest, they shall reign, 
                    And honour him who saved the realm for them, 
                    So little cared for as his own; and if---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Tis lost, all Earth will cry out, "thank your father!" 
                    And they will swell the echo with a curse.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    That they shall never do; but rather honour 
                    The name of him, who, dying like a king, 
                    In his last hours did more for his own memory 
                    Than many monarchs in a length of days, 
                    Which date the flight of time, but make no annals.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Our annals draw perchance unto their close; 
                    But at the least, whate'er the past, their end 
                    Shall be like their beginning---memorable.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Yet, be not rash---be careful of your life, 
                    Live but for those who love.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And who are they? 
                    A slave, who loves from passion---I'll not say 
                    Ambition---she has seen thrones shake, and loves; 
                    A few friends who have revelled till we are 
                    As one, for they are nothing if I fall; 
                    A brother I have injured---children whom 
                    I have neglected, and a spouse---
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Who loves.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And pardons?
                
                
                    Zar.
                     I have never thought of this, 
                    And cannot pardon till I have condemned.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My wife!
                
                
                    Zar.
                     Now blessings on thee for that word! 
                    I never thought to hear it more---from thee.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Oh! thou wilt hear it from my subjects. Yes--- 
                    These slaves whom I have nurtured, pampered, fed, 
                    And swoln with peace, and gorged with plenty, till 
                    They reign themselves---all monarchs in their mansions--- 
                    Now swarm forth in rebellion, and demand 
                    His death, who made their lives a jubilee; 
                    While the few upon whom I have no claim 
                    Are faithful! This is true, yet monstrous.
                
                
                    Zar.
                     'Tis 
                    Perhaps too natural; for benefits 
                    Turn poison in bad minds.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And good ones make 
                    Good out of evil. Happier than the bee, 
                    Which hives not but from wholesome flowers.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Then reap 
                    The honey, nor inquire whence 'tis derived. 
                    Be satisfied---you are not all abandoned.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My life insures me that. How long, bethink you, 
                    Were not I yet a king, should I be mortal; 
                    That is, where mortals are, not where they must be?
                
                
                    Zar.
                    I know not. But yet live for my---that is, 
                    Your children's sake!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    My gentle, wronged Zarina! 
                    I am the very slave of Circumstance 
                    And Impulse---borne away with every breath! 
                    Misplaced upon the throne---misplaced in life. 
                    I know not what I could have been, but feel 
                    I am not what I should be---let it end. 
                    But take this with thee: if I was not formed 
                    To prize a love like thine, a mind like thine, 
                    Nor dote even on thy beauty---as I've doted 
                    On lesser charms, for no cause save that such 
                    Devotion was a duty, and I hated 
                    All that looked like a chain for me or others 
                    (This even Rebellion must avouch); yet hear 
                    These words, perhaps among my last---that none 
                    E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not 
                    To profit by them---as the miner lights 
                    Upon a vein of virgin ore, discovering 
                    That which avails him nothing: he hath found it, 
                    But 'tis not his---but some superior's, who 
                    Placed him to dig, but not divide the wealth 
                    Which sparkles at his feet; nor dare he lift 
                    Nor poise it, but must grovel on, upturning 
                    The sullen earth.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Oh! if thou hast at length 
                    Discovered that my love is worth esteem, 
                    I ask no more---but let us hence together,
                    And I---let me say we---shall yet be happy.
                    Assyria is not all the earth---we'll find 
                    A world out of our own---and be more blessed 
                    Than I have ever been, or thou, with all 
                    An empire to indulge thee.
                
                Enter Salemenes.
                
                    Sal.
                     I must part ye--- 
                    The moments, which must not be lost, are passing.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Inhuman brother! wilt thou thus weigh out 
                    Instants so high and blest?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Blest!
                
                
                    Zar.
                    He hath been 
                    So gentle with me, that I cannot think 
                    Of quitting.
                
                Sal.
                    So---this feminine farewell 
                    Ends as such partings end, in
                    no departure. I thought as much, and yielded against all 
                    My better bodings. But it must not be.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Not be?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Remain, and perish---
                
                
                    Zar.
                    With my husband---
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And children.
                
                
                    Zar.
                     Alas!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Hear me, sister, like 
                    My sister:---all's prepared to make your safety
                    Certain, and of the boys too, our last hopes; 
                    'Tis not a single question of mere feeling, 
                    Though that were much---but 'tis a point of state: 
                    The rebels would do more to seize upon 
                    The offspring of their sovereign, and so crush---
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Ah! do not name it.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Well, then, mark me: when 
                    They are safe beyond the Median's grasp, the rebels 
                    Have missed their chief aim---the extinction of 
                    The line of Nimrod. Though the present King 
                    Fall, his sons live---for victory and vengeance.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    But could not I remain, alone?
                
                
                    Sal.
                     What! leave 
                    Your children, with two parents and yet orphans--- 
                    In a strange land---so young, so distant?
                
                
                    Zar.
                     No--- 
                    My heart will break.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     Now you know all---decide.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Zarina, he hath spoken well, and we 
                    Must yield awhile to this necessity. 
                    Remaining here, you may lose all; departing, 
                    You save the better part of what is left, 
                    To both of us, and to such loyal hearts 
                    As yet beat in these kingdoms.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     The time presses.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Go, then. If e'er we meet again, perhaps 
                    I may be worthier of you---and, if not, 
                    Remember that my faults, though not atoned for,
                    Are ended. Yet, I dread thy nature will
                    Grieve more above the blighted name and ashes 
                    Which once were mightiest in Assyria---than--- 
                    But I grow womanish again, and must not; 
                    I must learn sternness now. My sins have all
                    Been of the softer order---hide thy tears---
                    I do not bid thee not to shed them---'twere
                    Easier to stop Euphrates at its source 
                    Than one tear of a true and tender heart--- 
                    But let me not behold them; they unman me 
                    Here when I had remanned myself. My brother, 
                    Lead her away.
                
                
                    Zar.
                     Oh, God! I never shall 
                    Behold him more!
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    striving to conduct her
                    Nay, sister, I must be obeyed.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    I must remain---away! you shall not hold me. 
                    What, shall he die alone?---I live alone?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    He shall not die alone; but lonely you
                    Have lived for years.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    That's false! I knew he lived,
                    And lived upon his image---let me go!
                
                
                     Sal. 
                    conducting her off the stage
                    Nay, then, then, I must use some fraternal force, 
                    Which you will pardon.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    Never. Help me! Oh! 
                    Sardanapalus, wilt thou thus behold me 
                    Torn from thee?
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Nay---then all is lost again, 
                    If that this moment is not gained.
                
                
                    Zar.
                    My brain turns--- 
                    My eyes fail---where is he? 
                
                She faints.
                
                     Sar. 
                    advancing
                     No---set her down; 
                    She's dead---and you have slain her.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     'Tis the mere 
                    Faintness of o'erwrought passion: in the air 
                    She will recover. Pray, keep back.---Aside. I must
                    Avail myself of this sole moment to 
                    Bear her to where her children are embarked, 
                    I' the royal galley on the river.
                
                Salemenes bears her off.
                
                    Sar.
                    solus
                     This, too---
                    And this too must I suffer---I, who never 
                    Inflicted purposely on human hearts 
                    A voluntary pang! But that is false--- 
                    She loved me, and I loved her.---Fatal passion!
                    Why dost thou not expire at once in hearts
                    Which thou hast lighted up at once? Zarina! 
                    I must pay dearly for the desolation 
                    Now brought upon thee. Had I never loved 
                    But thee, I should have been an unopposed 
                    Monarch of honouring nations. To what gulfs 
                    A single deviation from the track 
                    Of human duties leads even those who claim 
                    The homage of mankind as their born due, 
                    And find it, till they forfeit it themselves!
                
                Enter Myrrha
                
                    Sar.
                    You here! Who called you?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    No one---but I heard 
                    Far off a voice of wail and lamentation, 
                    And thought---
                
                
                    Sar.
                    It forms no portion of your duties 
                    To enter here till sought for.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Though I might, 
                    Perhaps, recall some softer words of yours
                    (Although they too were chiding), which reproved me,
                     Because I ever dreaded to intrude; 
                    Resisting my own wish and your injunction 
                    To heed no time nor presence, but approach you 
                    Uncalled for:---I retire.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Yet stay---being here. 
                    I pray you pardon me: events have soured me 
                    Till I wax peevish---heed it not: I shall 
                    Soon be myself again.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I wait with patience, 
                    What I shall see with pleasure.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Scarce a moment 
                    Before your entrance in this hall, Zarina, 
                    Queen of Assyria, departed hence.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Ah!
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Wherefore do you start?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Did I do so?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Twas well you entered by another portal, 
                    Else you had met. That pang at least is spared her!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I know to feel for her.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    That is too much, 
                    And beyond nature---'tis nor mutual 
                    Nor possible. You cannot pity her, 
                    Nor she aught but---
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Despise the favourite slave? 
                    Not more than I have ever scorned myself.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Scorned! what, to be the envy of your sex, 
                    And lord it o'er the heart of the World's lord?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Were you the lord of twice ten thousand worlds--- 
                    As you are like to lose the one you swayed--- 
                    I did abase myself as much in being 
                    Your paramour, as though you were a peasant--- 
                    Nay, more, if that the peasant were a Greek.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    You talk it well---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     And truly.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    In the hour 
                    Of man's adversity all things grow daring 
                    Against the falling; but as I am not 
                    Quite fall'n, nor now disposed to bear reproaches, 
                    Perhaps because I merit them too often, 
                    Let us then part while peace is still between us.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Part!
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Have not all past human beings parted, 
                    And must not all the present one day part?
                
                
                    Myr.
                    Why?
                
                
                    Sar.
                     For your safety, which I will have looked to, 
                    With a strong escort to your native land; 
                    And such gifts, as, if you had not been all 
                    A Queen, shall make your dowry worth a kingdom.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    I pray you talk not thus.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     The Queen is gone: 
                    You need not shame to follow. I would fall 
                    Alone---I seek no partners but in pleasure.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    And I no pleasure but in parting not. 
                    You shall not force me from you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     Think well of it--- 
                    It soon may be too late.
                
                
                    Myr.
                    So let it be; 
                    For then you cannot separate me from you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    And will not; but I thought you wished it.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     I!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    You spoke of your abasement.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     And I feel it 
                    Deeply---more deeply than all things but love.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then fly from it.
                
                
                    Myr.
                     'Twill not recall the past--- 
                    'Twill not restore my honour, nor my heart. 
                    No---here I stand or fall. If that you conquer, 
                    I live to joy in your great triumph: should 
                    Your lot be different, I'll not weep, but share it. 
                    You did not doubt me a few hours ago.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Your courage never---nor your love till now; 
                    And none could make me doubt it save yourself. 
                    Those words---
                
                
                    Myr.
                     Were words. I pray you, let the proofs 
                    Be in the past acts you were pleased to praise 
                    This very night, and in my further bearing, 
                    Beside, wherever you are borne by fate.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I am content: and, trusting in my cause, 
                    Think we may yet be victors and return 
                    To peace---the only victory I covet. 
                    To me war is no glory---conquest no 
                    Renown. To be forced thus to uphold my right 
                    Sits heavier on my heart than all the wrongs 
                    These men would bow me down with. Never, never 
                    Can I forget this night, even should I live 
                    To add it to the memory of others. 
                    I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule 
                    An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals, 
                    A green spot amidst desert centuries, 
                    On which the Future would turn back and smile, 
                    And cultivate, or sigh when it could not 
                    Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign. 
                    I thought to have made my realm a paradise, 
                    And every moon an epoch of new pleasures. 
                    I took the rabble's shouts for love---the breath 
                    Of friends for truth---the lips of woman for 
                    My only guerdon---so they are, my Myrrha: 
                    He kisses her.
                    Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and life!
                    They shall have both, but never thee!
                
                
                    Myr.
                    No, never! 
                    Man may despoil his brother man of all 
                    That 's great or glittering---kingdoms fall, hosts yield, 
                    Friends fail---slaves fly---and all betray---and, more 
                    Than all, the most indebted---but a heart 
                    That loves without self-love! 'Tis here---now prove it.
                
                Enter Salemenes.
                
                    Sal.
                    I sought you---How! she here again?
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Return not
                    Now to reproof: methinks your aspect speaks
                    Of higher matter than a woman's presence.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    The only woman whom it much imports me 
                    At such a moment now is safe in absence--- 
                    The Queen 's embarked.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     And well? say that much.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Yes. 
                    Her transient weakness has passed o'er; at least, 
                    It settled into tearless silence: her 
                    Pale face and glittering eye, after a glance 
                    Upon her sleeping children, were still fixed 
                    Upon the palace towers as the swift galley 
                    Stole down the hurrying stream beneath the starlight; 
                    But she said nothing.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Would I felt no more 
                    Than she has said!
                
                
                    Sal.
                    'Tis now too late to feel. 
                    Your feelings cannot cancel a sole pang: 
                    To change them, my advices bring sure tidings 
                    That the rebellious Medes and Chaldees, marshalled 
                    By their two leaders, are already up 
                    In arms again; and, serrying their ranks, 
                    Prepare to attack: they have apparently 
                    Been joined by other Satraps.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    What! more rebels? 
                    Let us be first, then.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    That were hardly prudent 
                    Now, though it was our first intention. If 
                    By noon to-morrow we are joined by those 
                    I've sent for by sure messengers, we shall be 
                    In strength enough to venture an attack, 
                    Aye, and pursuit too; but, till then, my voice 
                    Is to await the onset.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    I detest 
                    That waiting; though it seems so safe to fight 
                    Behind high walls, and hurl down foes into 
                    Deep fosses, or behold them sprawl on spikes 
                    Strewed to receive them, still I like it not--- 
                    My soul seems lukewarm; but when I set on them, 
                    Though they were piled on mountains, I would have 
                    A pluck at them, or perish in hot blood!--- 
                    Let me then charge.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    You talk like a young soldier.
                
                
                    Sar.
                     I am no soldier, but a man: speak not 
                    Of soldiership, I loathe the word, and those 
                    Who pride themselves upon it; but direct me 
                    Where I may pour upon them.
                
                
                    Sal.
                     You must spare 
                    To expose your life too hastily; 'tis not 
                    Like mine or any other subject's breath: 
                    The whole war turns upon it---with it; this 
                    Alone creates it, kindles, and may quench it--- 
                    Prolong it---end it.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Then let us end both! 
                    'Twere better thus, perhaps, than prolong either; 
                    I'm sick of one, perchance of both.
                
                A trumpet sounds without.
                
                    Sal.
                     Hark!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Let us 
                    Reply, not listen.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    And your wound!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    'Tis bound--- 
                    'Tis healed---I had forgotten it. Away! 
                    A leech's lancet would have scratched me deeper; 
                    The slave that gave it might be well ashamed 
                    To have struck so weakly.
                
                
                    Sal.
                    Now, may none this hour 
                    Strike with a better aim!
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Aye, if we conquer; 
                    But if not, they will only leave to me 
                    A task they might have spared their king. Upon them!
                
                Trumpet sounds again.
                
                    Sal.
                    I am with you.
                
                
                    Sar.
                    Ho, my arms! again, my arms!
                
                Exeunt.
            
        
        
            ACT V.
            Scene I.
                ---The same Hall in the Palace.
                Myrrha and Balea
                 Myr. at a windowThe day at last has
                        broken. What a night 
                    Hath ushered it! How beautiful in heaven! 
                    Though varied with a transitory storm, 
                    More beautiful in that variety! 
                    How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope, 
                    And Love and Revel, in an hour were trampled 
                    By human passions to a human chaos, 
                    Not yet resolved to separate elements--- 
                    'Tis warring still! And can the sun so rise, 
                    So bright, so rolling back the clouds into 
                    Vapours more lovely than the unclouded sky, 
                    With golden pinnacles, and snowy mountains, 
                    And billows purpler than the Ocean's, making 
                    In heaven a glorious mockery of the earth, 
                    So like we almost deem it permanent; 
                    So fleeting, we can scarcely call it aught 
                    Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently 
                    Scattered along the eternal vault: and yet 
                    It dwells upon the soul, and soothes the soul, 
                    And blends itself into the soul, until 
                    Sunrise and sunset form the haunted epoch 
                    Of Sorrow and of Love; which they who mark not, 
                    Know not the realms where those twin genii 
                    (Who chasten and who purify our hearts, 
                    So that we would not change their sweet rebukes 
                    For all the boisterous joys that ever shook 
                    The air with clamour) build the palaces 
                    Where their fond votaries repose and breathe 
                    Briefly;---but in that brief cool calm inhale 
                    Enough of heaven to enable them to bear 
                    The rest of common, heavy, human hours, 
                    And dream them through in placid sufferance, 
                    Though seemingly employed like all the rest 
                    Of toiling breathers in allotted tasks 
                    Of pain or pleasure, two names for one feeling,
                    Which our internal, restless agony 
                    Would vary in the sound, although the sense 
                    Escapes our highest efforts to be happy.
                
                Bal.
                    You muse right calmly: and can you so watch 
                    The sunrise which may be our last?
                
                Myr.
                     It is 
                    Therefore that I so watch it, and reproach 
                    Those eyes, which never may behold it more, 
                    For having looked upon it oft, too oft, 
                    Without the reverence and the rapture due 
                    To that which keeps all earth from being as fragile 
                    As I am in this form. Come, look upon it, 
                    The Chaldee's God, which, when I gaze upon, 
                    I grow almost a convert to your Baal.
                
                Bal.
                     As now he reigns in heaven, so once on earth 
                    He swayed.
                
                Myr.
                     He sways it now for more, then; never 
                    Had earthly monarch half the power and glory 
                    Which centres in a single ray of his.
                
                Bal.
                    Surely he is a God!
                
                Myr.
                     So we Greeks deem too; 
                    And yet I sometimes think that gorgeous orb 
                    Must rather be the abode of Gods than one 
                    Of the immortal sovereigns. Now he breaks 
                    Through all the clouds, and fills my eyes with light 
                    That shuts the world out. I can look no more.
                
                Bal.
                    Hark! heard you not a sound?
                
                Myr.
                     No, 'twas mere fancy; 
                    They battle it beyond the wall, and not 
                    As in late midnight conflict in the very 
                    Chambers: the palace has become a fortress 
                    Since that insidious hour; and here, within 
                    The very centre, girded by vast courts 
                    And regal halls of pyramid proportions, 
                    Which must be carried one by one before 
                    They penetrate to where they then arrived, 
                    We are as much shut in even from the sound 
                    Of peril as from glory.
                
                Bal.
                    But they reached 
                    Thus far before.
                
                Myr.
                    Yes, by surprise, and were 
                    Beat back by valour: now at once we have 
                    Courage and vigilance to guard us.
                
                Bal.
                    May they 
                    Prosper!
                
                Myr.
                    That is the prayer of many, and 
                    The dread of more: it is an anxious hour; 
                    I strive to keep it from my thoughts. Alas! 
                    How vainly!
                
                Bal.
                    It is said the King's demeanour 
                    In the late action scarcely more appalled 
                    The rebels than astonished his true subjects.
                
                Myr.
                    'Tis easy to astonish or appal 
                    The vulgar mass which moulds a horde of slaves; 
                    But he did bravely.
                
                Bal.
                     Slew he not Beleses? 
                    I heard the soldiers say he struck him down.
                
                Myr.
                    The wretch was overthrown, but rescued to 
                    Triumph, perhaps, o'er one who vanquished him 
                    In fight, as he had spared him in his peril; 
                    And by that heedless pity risked a crown.
                
                Bal.
                     Hark!
                
                Myr.
                    You are right; some steps approach, but slowly.
                Enter Soldiers, bearing in Salemenes wounded, with a broken
                    javelin in his side: they seat him upon one of the couches which furnish the
                    Apartment.
                Myr.
                    Oh, Jove!
                
                Bal.
                     Then all is over.
                
                Sal.
                     That is false. 
                    Hew down the slave who says so, if a soldier.
                
                Myr.
                    Spare him---he's none: a mere court butterfly, 
                    That flutter in the pageant of a monarch.
                
                Sal.
                    Let him live on, then.
                
                Myr.
                    So wilt thou, I trust.
                
                Sal.
                    I fain would live this hour out, and the event, 
                    But doubt it. Wherefore did ye bear me here?
                
                Sol.
                    By the King's order. When the javelin struck you, 
                    You fell and fainted: 'twas his strict command 
                    To bear you to this hall.
                
                Sal.
                    'Twas not ill done: 
                    For seeming slain in that cold dizzy trance, 
                    The sight might shake our soldiers---but---'tis vain, 
                    I feel it ebbing!
                
                Myr.
                    Let me see the wound; 
                    I am not quite skilless: in my native land 
                    'Tis part of our instruction. War being constant, 
                    We are nerved to look on such things.
                
                Sol.
                    Best extract 
                    The javelin.
                
                Myr.
                    Hold! no, no, it cannot be.
                
                Sal.
                    I am sped, then!
                
                Myr.
                     With the blood that fast must follow 
                    The extracted weapon, I do fear thy life.
                
                Sal.
                    And I
                    not . death. Where was the King when you Conveyed me from the
                        spot where I was stricken?
                
                Sol.
                    Upon the same ground, and encouraging 
                    With voice and gesture the dispirited troops 
                    Who had seen you fall, and faltered back.

                Sol.
                    I did not hear.

                    Fly, then, and tell him, 'twas my last request 
                    That Zames take my post until the junction, 
                    So hoped for, yet delayed, of Ofratanes, 
                    Satrap of Susa. Leave me here: our troops 
                    Are not so numerous as to spare your absence.

                    Hence, I say! Here 's a courtier and 
                    A woman, the best chamber company. 
                    As you would not permit me to expire 
                    Upon the field, I'll have no idle soldiers 
                    About my sick couch. Hence! and do my bidding!

                    Gentle Myrrha, 'tis 
                    The end I would have chosen, had I saved 
                    The monarch or the monarchy by this; 
                    As 'tis, I have not outlived them.

                    Your hand; this broken weapon but prolongs 
                    My pangs, without sustaining life enough 
                    To make me useful: I would draw it forth 
                    And my life with it, could I but hear how 
                    The fight goes.

                    I'd rather see you thus!
                He draws out the weapon from the wound, and dies.
                Sar.
                    And
                    thus I will be seen; unless the succour, The last frail reed of
                        our beleagured hopes, 
                    Arrive with Ofratanes.

                    Did you not 
                    Receive a token from your dying brother, 
                    Appointing Zames chief?

                    Pania yet lives; but Sfero's fled or captive.

                    Our walls, 
                    Though thinly manned, may still hold out against 
                    Their present force, or aught save treachery: 
                    But i' the field---
                
                Myr.
                    I thought 'twas the intent 
                    Of Salemenes not to risk a sally 
                    Till ye were strengthened by the expected succours.

                      Well, the fault's a brave one.
                Sar.
                    But fatal. Oh, my brother! I would give 
                    These realms, of which thou wert the ornament, 
                    The sword and shield, the sole-redeeming honour, 
                    To call back---But I will not weep for thee; 
                    Thou shalt be mourned for as thou wouldst be mourned. 
                    It grieves me most that thou couldst quit this life 
                    Believing that I could survive what thou 
                    Hast died for---our long royalty of race. 
                    If I redeem it, I will give thee blood 
                    Of thousands, tears of millions, for atonement, 
                    (The tears of all the good are thine already). 
                    If not, we meet again soon,---if the spirit 
                    Within us lives beyond:---thou readest mine, 
                    And dost me justice now. Let me once clasp 
                    That yet warm hand, and fold that throbless heart 
                    Embraces the body.
                    To this which beats so bitterly. Now, bear
                    The body hence.

                    Where?

                    To my proper chamber. 
                    Place it beneath my canopy, as though 
                    The King lay there: when this is done, we will 
                    Speak further of the rites due to such ashes.
                 Exeunt Soldiers with the body of Salemenes
                Enter. Pania.
                Sar.
                    Well, Pania! have you placed the guards, and issued 
                    The orders fixed on?
                
                Pan.
                    Sire, I have obeyed.
                
                Sar.
                    And do the soldiers keep their hearts up?
                
                Pan.
                     Sire?
                
                Sar.
                    I am answered! When a king asks twice, and has
                    A question as an answer to his question,
                    It is a portent. What! they are disheartened?
                
                Pan.
                    The death of Salemenes, and the shouts 
                    Of the exulting rebels on his fall, 
                    Have made them---
                
                Sar.
                    Rage ---not droop---it should have been. We'll find the means to
                        rouse them.
                
                Pan.
                    Such a loss 
                    Might sadden even a victory.
                
                Sar.
                    Alas! 
                    Who can so feel it as I feel? but yet, 
                    Though cooped within these walls, they are strong, and we 
                    Have those without will break their way through hosts, 
                    To make their sovereign's dwelling what it was--- 
                    A palace, not a prison---nor a fortress.
                Enter an Officer, hastily.
                Sar.
                    Thy face seems ominous. Speak!
                
                Offi.
                    I dare not.
                
                Sar.
                    Dare not? 
                    While millions dare revolt with sword in hand! 
                    That's strange. I pray thee break that loyal silence 
                    Which loathes to shock its sovereign; we can hear 
                    Worse than thou hast to tell.
                
                Pan.
                    Proceed---thou hearest.
                
                Offi.
                    The wall which skirted near the river's brink 
                    Is thrown down by the sudden inundation 
                    Of the Euphrates, which now rolling, swoln 
                    From the enormous mountains where it rises, 
                    By the late rains of that tempestuous region, 
                    O'erfloods its banks, and hath destroyed the bulwark.
                
                Pan.
                    That's a black augury! it has been said 
                    For ages, "That the City ne'er should yield 
                    "To man, until the River grew its foe."
                
                Sar.
                    I can forgive the omen, not the ravage. 
                    How much is swept down of the wall?
                
                Offi.
                     About 
                    Some twenty stadia.
                
                Sar.
                     And all this is left 
                    Pervious to the assailants?
                
                Offi.
                     For the present 
                    The River's fury must impede the assault; 
                    But when he shrinks into his wonted channel, 
                    And may be crossed by the accustomed barks, 
                    The palace is their own.
                
                Sar.
                    That shall be never. 
                    Though men, and gods, and elements, and omens, 
                    Have risen up 'gainst one who ne'er provoked them, 
                    My father's house shall never be a cave 
                    For wolves to horde and howl in.
                
                Pan.
                    With your sanction, 
                    I will proceed to the spot, and take such measures 
                    For the assurance of the vacant space 
                    As time and means permit.
                
                Sar.
                    About it straight, 
                    And bring me back, as speedily as full 
                    And fair investigation may permit, 
                    Report of the true state of this irruption 
                    Of waters. 
                 Exeunt Pania and the Officer. 
                Myr.
                     Thus the very waves rise up 
                    Against you.
                
                Sar.
                    They are not my subjects, girl, 
                    And may be pardoned, since they can't be punished.
                
                Myr.
                     I joy to see this portent shakes you not.
                
                Sar.
                    I am past the fear of portents: they can tell me 
                    Nothing I have not told myself since midnight: 
                    Despair anticipates such things.
                
                Myr.
                    Despair!
                
                Sar.
                    No; not despair precisely. When we know 
                    All that can come, and how to meet it, our 
                    Resolves, if firm, may merit a more noble 
                    Word than this is to give it utterance. 
                    But what are words to us? we have well nigh done 
                    With them and all things.
                
                Myr.
                      Save one deed ---the last And greatest to all
                        mortals; crowning act 
                    Of all that was, or is, or is to be--- 
                    The only thing common to all mankind, 
                    So different in their births, tongues, sexes, natures, 
                    Hues, features, climes, times, feelings, intellects, 
                    Without one point of union save in this--- 
                    To which we tend, for which we're born, and thread 
                    The labyrinth of mystery, called life.
                
                Sar.
                    Our clue being well nigh wound out, let's be cheerful. 
                    They who have nothing more to fear may well 
                    Indulge a smile at that which once appalled; 
                    As children at discovered bugbears.

                     'Tis 
                    As was reported: I have ordered there 
                    A double guard, withdrawing from the wall, 
                    Where it was strongest, the required addition 
                    To watch the breach occasioned by the waters.
                
                Sar.
                    You have done your duty faithfully, and as 
                    My worthy Pania! further ties between us 
                    Draw near a close---I pray you take this key: 
                    Gives a key.
                    It opens to a secret chamber, placed
                    Behind the couch in my own chamber---(Now 
                    Pressed by a nobler weight than e'er it bore--- 
                    Though a long line of sovereigns have lain down 
                    Along its golden frame---as bearing for 
                    A time what late was Salemenes.)---Search 
                    The secret covert to which this will lead you; 
                    'Tis full of treasure; take it for yourself 
                    And your companions: there's enough to load ye, 
                    Though ye be many. Let the slaves be freed, too; 
                    And all the inmates of the palace, of 
                    Whatever sex, now quit it in an hour. 
                    Thence launch the regal barks, once formed for pleasure, 
                    And now to serve for safety, and embark.

                    No, Pania! that must not be; get thee hence,

                    Well, then,

                    With a heavy but true heart, 
                    I promise.
                
                Sar.
                    'Tis enough. Now order here

                    Bring cedar, too, and precious drugs, and spices, 
                    And mighty planks, to nourish a tall pile; 
                    Bring frankincense and myrrh, too, for it is 
                    For a great sacrifice I build the pyre!

                    My King, in going forth upon my duty,
                    This herald has been brought before me, craving 
                    An audience.
                
                Sar.
                    Let him speak.

                    Of what god or demon? 
                    With new kings rise new altars. But, proceed; 
                    You are sent to prate your master's will, and not

                    Poor Salemenes! thou hast died in time 
                    To see one treachery the less: this man 
                    Was thy true friend and my most trusted subject.

                    In any of the further provinces, 
                    Guarded and watched, but not confined in person, 
                    Where thou shalt pass thy days in peace; but on 
                    Condition that the three young princes are 
                    Given up as hostages.

                Her.
                    I wait the answer.
                
                Sar.
                     Answer, slave! How long 
                    Have slaves decided on the doom of kings?
                
                Her.
                    Since they were free.

                     Mouthpiece of mutiny! 
                    Thou at the least shalt learn the penalty 
                    Of treason, though its proxy only. Pania! 
                    Let his head be thrown from our walls within 
                    The rebels' lines, his carcass down the river. 
                    Away with him!

                Pan.
                     I never yet obeyed 
                    Your orders with more pleasure than the present. 
                    Hence with him, soldiers! do not soil this hall 
                    Of royalty with treasonable gore; 
                    Put him to rest without.
                
                Her.
                    A single word: 
                    My office, King, is sacred.
                
                Sar.
                    And what's
                    mine?
                    That thou shouldst come and dare to ask of me 
                    To lay it down?
                
                Her.
                    I but obeyed my orders, 
                    At the same peril if refused, as now 
                    Incurred by my obedience.

                    So there are 
                    New monarchs of an hour's growth as despotic 
                    As sovereigns swathed in purple, and enthroned 
                    From birth to manhood!
                
                Her.
                    My life waits your breath. 
                    Yours (I speak humbly)---but it may be---yours 
                    May also be in danger scarce less imminent: 
                    Would it then suit the last hours of a line 
                    Such as is that of Nimrod, to destroy 
                    A peaceful herald, unarmed, in his office; 
                    And violate not only all that man 
                    Holds sacred between man and man---but that 
                    More holy tie which links us with the Gods?
                
                Sar.
                    He's right.---Let him go free.---My life's last act 
                    Shall not be one of wrath. Here, fellow, take

                    This golden goblet, let it hold your wine, 
                    And think of me; or melt it into ingots,
                    And think of nothing but their weight and value.
                
                Her.
                    I thank you doubly for my life, and this 
                    Most gorgeous gift, which renders it more precious. 
                    But must I bear no answer?
                
                Sar.
                    Yes,---I ask 
                    An hour's truce to consider.
                
                Her.
                    But an hour's?
                
                Sar.
                    An hour's: if at the expiration of 
                    That time your masters hear no further from me, 
                    They are to deem that I reject their terms,

                Her.
                     I shall not fail 
                    To be a faithful legate of your pleasure.

                    And hark! a word more.
                
                Her.
                     I shall not forget it,

                    Commend me to Beleses; 
                    And tell him, ere a year expire, I summon

                    Where?
                
                Sar.
                    At Babylon. 
                    At least from thence he will depart to meet me.
                
                Her.
                    I shall obey you to the letter.

                Pan.
                    My Lord,---the soldiers are already charged.
                And see! they enter.
                Soldiers enter, and form a Pile about the Throne, etc.
                Sar.
                     Higher, my good soldiers, 
                    And thicker yet; and see that the foundation 
                    Be such as will not speedily exhaust 
                    Its own too subtle flame; nor yet be quenched 
                    With aught officious aid would bring to quell it.
                    Let the throne form the core of it; I would not
                    Leave that, save fraught with fire unquenchable, 
                    To the new comers. Frame the whole as if 
                    'Twere to enkindle the strong tower of our 
                    Inveterate enemies. Now it bears an aspect! 
                    How say you, Pania, will this pile suffice 
                    For a King's obsequies?
                
                Pan.
                    Aye, for a kingdom's.

                    And blame me?

                    No---

                     I should shame to leave my sovereign

                     Search well my chamber, 
                    Feel no remorse at bearing off the gold; 
                    Remember, what you leave you leave the slaves 
                    Who slew me: and when you have borne away 
                    All safe off to your boats, blow one long blast 
                    Upon the trumpet as you quit the palace. 
                    The river's brink is too remote, its stream 
                    Too loud at present to permit the echo 
                    To reach distinctly from its banks. Then fly,--- 
                    And as you sail, turn back; but still keep on 
                    Your way along the Euphrates: if you reach 
                    The land of Paphlagonia, where the Queen 
                    Is safe with my three sons in Cotta's court,
                    Say what you saw at parting, and request
                    That she remember what I said at one
                    Parting more mournful still.
                
                Pan.
                    That royal hand! 
                    Let me then once more press it to my lips; 
                    And these poor soldiers who throng round you, and 
                    Would fain die with you!
                The Soldiers and Pania throng round him, kissing his hand
                    and the hem of his robe.

                     My best! my last friends! 
                    Let's not unman each other: part at once: 
                    All farewells should be sudden, when for ever, 
                    Else they make an eternity of moments, 
                    And clog the last sad sands of life with tears. 
                    Hence, and be happy: trust me, I am not 
                    Now to be pitied; or far more for what
                    Is past than present;---for the future, 'tis 
                    In the hands of the deities, if such 
                    There be: I shall know soon. Farewell---Farewell.

                    These men were honest: it is comfort still 
                    That our last looks should be on loving faces.

                    The brink,---thou feel'st an inward shrinking from 
                    This leap through flame into the future, say it: 
                    I shall not love thee less; nay, perhaps more, 
                    For yielding to thy nature: and there's time 
                    Yet for thee to escape hence.

                    The ever-burning lamp that burns without, 
                    Before Baal's shrine, in the adjoining hall?

                    Do so. Is that thy answer?

                        I will rejoin, 
                    It may be, purified by death from some 
                    Of the gross stains of too material being, 
                    I would not leave your ancient first abode 
                    To the defilement of usurping bondmen; 
                    If I have not kept your inheritance 
                    As ye bequeathed it, this bright part of it, 
                    Your treasure---your abode---your sacred relics 
                    Of arms, and records---monuments, and spoils,
                    In which they would have revelled, I bear with me
                    To you in that absorbing element, 
                    Which most personifies the soul as leaving 
                    The least of matter unconsumed before 
                    Its fiery workings:---and the light of this 
                    Most royal of funereal pyres shall be 
                    Not a mere pillar formed of cloud and flame, 
                    A beacon in the horizon for a day, 
                    And then a mount of ashes---but a light 
                    To lesson ages, rebel nations, and 
                    Voluptuous princes. Time shall quench full many 
                    A people's records, and a hero's acts; 
                    Sweep empire after empire, like this first 
                    Of empires, into nothing; but even then 
                    Shall spare this deed of mine, and hold it up 
                    A problem few dare imitate, and none 
                    Despise---but, it may be, avoid the life 
                    Which led to such a consummation.

                     Lo! 
                    I've lit the lamp which lights us to the stars.
                
                Sar.
                    And the cup?
                
                Myr.
                     'Tis my country's custom to 
                    Make a libation to the Gods.
                
                Sar.
                     And mine 
                    To make libations amongst men. I've not 
                    Forgot the custom; and although alone, 
                    Will drain one draught in memory of many 
                    A joyous banquet past.
                    Sardanapalus takes the cup, and after drinking and
                        tinkling the reversed cup, as a drop falls, exclaims---
                     And this libation
                    Is for the excellent Beleses.

                    Why 
                    Dwells thy mind rather upon that man's name 
                    Than on his mate's in villany?
                
                Sar.
                    The other 
                    Is a mere soldier, a mere tool, a kind 
                    Of human sword in a friend's hand; the other 
                    Is master-mover of his warlike puppet; 
                    But I dismiss them from my mind.---Yet pause, 
                    My Myrrha! dost thou truly follow me, 
                    Freely and fearlessly?
                
                Myr.
                    And dost thou think 
                    A Greek girl dare not do for love, that which 
                    An Indian widow braves for custom?
                
                Sar.
                    Then 
                    We but await the signal.

                    It is long 
                    In sounding.
                
                Sar.
                    Now, farewell; one last embrace.
                
                Myr.
                    Embrace, but
                    not the last; there is one more. 
                Sar.
                    True, the commingling fire will mix our ashes.
                
                Myr.
                    And pure as is my love to thee, shall they, 
                    Purged from the dross of earth, and earthly passion, 
                    Mix pale with thine. A single thought yet irks me.
                
                Sar.
                    Say it.
                
                Myr.
                    It is that no kind hand will gather 
                    The dust of both into one urn.
                
                Sar.
                     The better: 
                    Rather let them be borne abroad upon 
                    The winds of heaven, and scattered into air, 
                    Than be polluted more by human hands 
                    Of slaves and traitors. In this blazing palace, 
                    And its enormous walls of reeking ruin, 
                    We leave a nobler monument than Egypt 
                    Hath piled in her brick mountains, o'er dead kings,
                    Or kine---for none know whether those proud piles
                    Be for their monarch, or their ox-god Apis: 
                    So much for monuments that have forgotten 
                    Their very record!
                
                Myr.
                     Then farewell, thou earth! 
                    And loveliest spot of earth! farewell, Ionia! 
                    Be thou still free and beautiful, and far 
                    Aloof from desolation! My last prayer 
                    Was for thee, my last thoughts, save one, were of
                    thee!
                Sar.
                    And that?
                
                Myr.
                     Is yours.
                 The trumpet of Pania sounds without.
                Sar.
                     Hark!
                
                Myr.
                    Now!
                Sar.
                     Adieu, Assyria! 
                    I loved thee well, my own, my fathers' land, 
                    And better as my country than my kingdom. 
                    I sated thee with peace and joys; and this 
                    Is my reward! and now I owe thee nothing, 
                    Not even a grave. 
                    He mounts the pile.
                     Now, Myrrha!
                Myr.
                    Art thou ready?
                
                Sar.
                    As the torch in thy grasp.
                Myrrha fires the pile.
                Myr.
                     'Tis fired! I come.
                As Myrrhasprings forward to throw herself into the flames,
                    the Curtain falls.
