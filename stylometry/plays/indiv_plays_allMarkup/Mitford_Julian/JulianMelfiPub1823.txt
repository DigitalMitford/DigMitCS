               Scene 1:
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace.
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace. Julian sleeping on a Couch. Annabel.
               
                  Annab.
                  No; still he
							sleeps! ’Twas but the myrtle
							bud
                  Tapping against the casement, as the wind
                  Stirred in the leafy branches. Well he loved
                  That pleasant bird-like sound, which, as a voice
                  Summon’d us forth into the fresher
							air
                  Of eve, or early morn. Ah! when
							again—
                  And yet his sleep is hopeful. For seven nights
                  He had not tasted slumber. Who comes here?
                  Enter Alfonso as Theodore
                  The gentle page! Alas! To wake him now!
                  Hush, Theodore! Tread softly—softlier, boy!
               
               
                  Alfon-
                  Doth he still sleep?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Speak lower.
               
               
                  Alfon
                  Doth he sleep?
               
               
                  Annab
                  Avoid the couch; come this way; close to me.
                  
                  He sleeps. He hath not moved in all the hours
                  That thou hast been away.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Then we may hope,
                  Dear lady, we may hope!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alas! Alas!
                  See how he lies, scarce breathing. Whilst I hung
                  Over his couch I should have thought him
							dead,
                  but for his short and frequent sighs.
               
               
                  Alfon
                  Ah me!
                  Not even in slumber can he lose the sense
                  Of that deep misery; and I—he wakes!
                  Dost thou not see the quivering mantle heave
                  With sudden motion?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou hast wakened him.
                  Thy clamorous grief hath roused him. Hence! Begone!
                  Leave me!
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  And yet his eyes are closed. He sleeps.
                  He did but move his hand.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  How changed he is!
                  How pale! How wasted! Can one little
							week
                  
                  Of pain and sickness so have faded thee,
                  My princely Julian! But eight days ago
                  There lived not in this gladsome Sicily
                  So glad a spirit. Voice, and step, and eye,
                  All were one happiness; till that dread
							hour,
                  When drest in sparkling smiles, radiant and
							glowing,
                  With tender thoughts, he flew to meet the King
                  And his great father. He went forth
							alone;
                  Frenzy and grief came back with him.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  And I, 
                  Another grief.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou wast a comforter.
                  All stranger as thou art, hast thou not shared
                  My watch as carefully, as faithfully,
                  As I had been thy
							sister? Aye, and he
                  If ever in this wild mysterious woe
                  One sight or sound hath cheered him, it hath been
                  A glance, a word of thine.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  He knows me not.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  He knows not me.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I never heard before
                  That ’twas to meet the King yon fatal
					          		night—
                  Knowingly, purposely— How could he guess
                  That they should meet? What moved him to that thought?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stranger, although thou be, thou canst but know
                  Prince Julian’s father is the regent here,
                  And rules for his young kinsman King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye—Poor Alfonso!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Wherefore pity him?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I know not—but I am an orphan
							too!
                  I interrupt thee, lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Yet, in truth,
                  A gentle pity lingers round the name
                  Of King Alfonso orphaned, as thou
							sayst,
                  And drooping into sickness when he
							lost
                  His father, ever since, the mournful
							boy
                  Hath dwelt in the Villa d’Oro.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Hast thou seen him?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  The King? No— I’m of Naples. When Prince Julian
                  First brought me here a bride, his royal
							cousin
                  Was fixed beside his father’s dying bed.
                  I never saw him: yet I know him
							well;
                  For I have sate and listen’d, hour by hour,
                  To hear my husband speak of the fair
							Prince,
                  
                  And his excelling virtues.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Did he?—Ah!--
                  But ’twas his wont, talking of those he loved,
                  To gild them with the rich, and burnish’d glow
                  Of his own brightness, as the evening sun
                  Decks all the clouds in glory.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Very dear
                  Was that young boy to Julian. ’Twas a
							friendship,
                  Fonder than common, blended with a kind
                  Protecting tenderness; such as brother
                  Might fitly shew unto the younger born.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Oh, he hath proved it.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Thou dost know them both?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I do. Say on, dear lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Three weeks
							since
                  The Duke of Melfi went to bring his ward
                  Here to Messina—
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  To be crowned. They came not.
                  But wherefore went Prince Julian forth to meet them?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Father nor cousin came; nor messenger,
                  From Regent or from King; and Julian
							chafed
                  And fretted at delay. At length, a
							peasant,
                  No liveried groom; a slow foot-pacing serf,
                  Brought tidings that the royal two, that
							morn
                  Left Villa d’Oro. Glowing from the chase
                  Prince Julian stood, the bridle in his hand,
                  New lighted, soothing now his prancing steed.
                  
                  And prattling now to me;— for I was still
                  So foolish fond to fly into the porch
                  To meet him, when I heard the quick sharp
									tread
                  Of that bright Arab, whose proud step I knew
                  Even as his master’s voice. He heard the tale
                  And instant sprang again into his seat,
                  Wheeled round, and darted off at such a pace
                  As the fleet greyhound, at her speed, could
									scarce
                  Have matched. He spake no word; but as he
									passed,
                  
                  Just glanced back at me, with his dancing eyes,
                  And such a smile of joy, and such a wave
                  Of his plumed bonnet! His return thou
							know’st.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I was his wretched partner.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He on foot,
                  Thou on the o’er-travelled horse, slow, yet all
							stained
                  With sweat, and panting, as if fresh escaped
                  From hot pursuit; and how he called for wine
                  For his poor Theodore, his faithful
							page;
                  
                  Then sate him down and shook with the cold fit
                  Of anguish fever, till the strong couch rocked
                  Like a child’s cradle. There he sate and sigh’d;
                  And then the frenzy came. Theodore!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Lady!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He utters nought but madness;—yet sometimes,
                  Athwart his ravings, I have thought—have
							feared—
                  Theodore, thou must know the
							cause?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Too well.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, tell me—
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Hush! He
							wakes.
               
               Alfonso retires behind the couch, out of Julian’s sight.
               
                  Annab.
                  Going to Julian, whilst Alfonso keeps behind the couch, out of his sight
                  Julian! Dear Julian!
               
               
                  Julian
                  Sure I have slept a long, long while! Where am I?
                  How came I hither? Whose kind hand is this?
                  My Annabel!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, what a happiness 
                  To see thee gently wake from gentle sleep!
                  
                  Art thou not better? Shall I raise thee up?
               
               
                  Julian
                  Aye, dearest. Have I then been ill? I’m
							weak,
                  I trouble thee, my sweet one.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  ’Tis a joy
                  To minister unto thee.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Wipe my brow.
                  And part these locks, that the fresh air may cool
                  My forehead; feel; it
							burns.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alas! how wild
                  This long neglect hath made thy glossy
							curls,
                  How tangled!
               
               
                  Julian
                  I am faint. Pray, lay me down.
                  Surely the day is stifling
               
               
                  Annab.
                  There.Good boy.
                  Throw wide the casement. Doth not the soft breeze
                  Revive thee?
               
               
                  Julian
                  
                  Yes. I’m better. I will rise.
                  Raise me again;—more upright;— So! Dear
									wife,
                  A sick man is as wayward as a child;
                  
                  Have I been long ill?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  A week.
               
               
                  Julian
                  I have no memory of aught. ’Tis just
                  Like waking from a dream; a
							horrible
                  Confusion of strange miseries; crime and
							blood
                  And all I love.— Great Heaven, how clear it
							seems!
                  How like a truth! I thought that I rode forth
                  On my white Barbary horse—Say, did I
							ride
                  Alone that day?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Did I? Could I? No.
                  Thou dost mistake. I did not. Yet ’tis
							strange
                  How plain that horror lives within my
							brain
                  As what hath been.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Forget it.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel,
                  I thought I was upon that gallant steed
                  At his full pace. Like clouds before the wind
                  We flew, as easily as the strong bird
                  That soars nearest the sun; till in a
							pass,
                  
                  Between the mountains, screams and cries of
							help
                  Rang in mine ears, and I beheld—O
							God!
                  It was not—Could not—No. I have been sick
                  Of a sharp fever, and delirium shews,
                  And to the bodily sense makes palpable,
                  Unreal forms, objects of sight and
							sound
                  Which have no being save in the burning
							brain
                  Of the poor sufferer. Why should it shake me!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Couldst thou walk to the window and
							quaff down
                  The fragrant breeze, it would revive thee more
                  Than food or sleep. Forget these evil dreams.
                  Canst thou not walk?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ll try.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Lean upon me,
                  And Theodore. Approach dear boy; support him.
                  Alfonso approaches Julian
               
               
                  Julian.
                  seeing Alfonso
                  Ha! Art thou here? Thou! I am blinded, dazzled!
                  Is this a vision, this fair shape that seems
                  A living child? Do I dream now?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He is
                  Young Theodore. The page, who that sad night
                  Returned—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Then all is real. Lay me down
                  That I may die
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas! I feared too surely
                  That when he saw me,—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Julian! This is grief,
                  Not sickness. Julian!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Rouse him not, dear
							lady!
                  See how his hands are clenched. Waken him
							not
                  To frenzy. Oh that I alone could bear
                  This weight of misery.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He knows the cause, 
                  And I— It is my right, my privilege
                  To share thy woes, to soothe them. I’ll weep with thee,
                  And that will be a comfort. Didst thou think
                  
                  Thou could’st be dearer to me than
						            	before
                  When thou wast well and happy? But thou art
                  Now. Tell me this secret.  I’ll be faithful,
                  I’ll never breathe a word. Oh spare my
							heart
                  This agony of doubt! What was the horror
                  That maddened thee?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Within the rifted rocks
                  Of high Albano, rotting in a glen,
                  Dark, dark at very noon, a father lies
                  Murdered by his own son.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And thou didst see
                  The deed! An awful sight to one so good!
                  Yet—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Birds obscene, and wolf, and ravening fox,
                  Ere this— only the dark hairs on the ground.
                  And the brown crusted blood! And she can ask
                  Why I am mad!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh! a thrice awful night
                  To one so duteous! Holy priests should lave
                  With blessed water that foul spot, and thou,
                  Pious and pitying, thou shalt—
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Hear at once,
                  Innocent Torturer, that drop by drop
                  Pour’st molten lead into my wounds—that glen—
                  Hang not upon me!—In that darksome glen
                  My father lies. I am a murderer,
                  A parricide, accurst of God and man.
                  Let go my hand! purest and whitest saint,
                  Let go!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  This is a madness. Even now
                  The fever shakes him.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Why, the mad are happy!
                  Annabel, this is a soul-slaying truth.
                  There stands a witness.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian knew him not.
                  It was to save a life, a worthless
							life.
                  Oh that I had but died beneath the sword
                  That seemed so terrible! That I had ne’er
                  Been born to grieve thee Julian! Pardon me,
                  Dear lady, pardon me!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh, gentle boy,
                  
                  How shall we soothe this grief?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas! alas!
                  Why did he rescue me! I’m a poor orphan;
                  None would have wept for me; I had no
							friend
                  In all the worldsave one. I had been reared.
                  In simpleness; a quiet grave had been
                  A fitter home for me than the rude world;
                  A mossy heap, no stone, no epitaph,
                  Save the brief words of grief and praise (for Grief
                  Is still a Praiser) he perchance had spoke
                  When they first told him the poor boy was dead.
                  Shame on me, that I shunned the sword!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  By Heaven,
                  It could not be a crime to save thee! kneel
                  Before him, Annabel. He is the king
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alfonso?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye, so please you, fairest Cousin,
                  But still your servant. Do not hate me,
							Lady,
                  Though I have caused this misery. We have shared
                  One care, one fear, one hope, have watched and wept
                  Together. Oh how often I have longed,
                  As we sate silent by his restless couch,
                  To fall upon thy neck and mix our tears,
                  And talk of him. I am his own poor Cousin.
                  Thou wilt not hate me?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Save that lost one, who
                  Could hate such innocence?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Twas not in hate,
                  But wild ambition. No ignoble sin
                  Dwelt in his breast. Ambition, mad ambition,
                  That was his Idol. To that bloody god
                  He offered up the milk-white
							sacrifice,
                  The pure, unspotted Victim. And even then,
                  Even in the crime, without a breathing space
                  For penitence, or prayer, my sword—Alfonso,
                  Thou would’st have gone to Heaven.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Art thou certain
                  That he is dead?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I saw him fall. The ground
                  Was covered with his blood.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Tell me the tale.
                  Didst thou— I would not wantonly recall
                  That scene of anguish—Didst thou search his wound?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel, in my eyes that scene will dwell
                  For ever, shutting out all lovely sights,
                  Even thee, my Beautiful! That torturing thought
                  Will burn a living fire within my
						            	breast
                  Perpetually; words can nothing add,
                  And nothing take away. Fear not my frenzy;
                  I am calm now. Thou know’st how buoyantly
                  I darted from thee, straight o’er vale and hill,
                  Counting the miles by minutes. At the pass
                  Between the Albano mountains, I first breathed
                  A moment my hot steed, expecting still
                  To see the royal escort. Afar off
                  As I stood, shading with my hand my eyes,
                  I thought I saw them; when at once I heard
                  From the deep glen, east of the pass, loud cries
                  Of mortal terror. Even in agony
                  I knew the voice, and darting through the trees.
                  I saw Alfonso, prostrate on the ground,
                  Clinging around the knees of one, who held
                  A dagger over him in act to strike,
                  Yet with averted head, as if he feared
                  To see his innocent victim. His own face
                  Was hidden; till at one spring I plunged my sword
                  
                  Into his side; then our eyes met, and he—
                  
                     That was the mortal blow!
									—screamed and stretched out
                  His hands. Falling and dying as he was,
                  He half rose up, hung speechless in the air,
                  And looked—Oh what had been the bitterest
									curse
                  To such a look! It smote me like a sword!
                  Here, here. He died.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I could have lain
                  In that dark glen for ever; but there stood
                  The dear-bought, and the dear, kinsman and prince
                  And friend. We heard the far-off clang of steeds
                  And armed men, and fearing some new foe,
                  Came homeward.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  And did he, then, the unhappy,
                  Remain upon the ground?
               
               
                  Julisn.
                  Alas! he did. 
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh! it was but a swoon. Listen, dear Julian,
                  I tell thee I have comfort.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  There is none
                  Left in the world. But I will listen to thee
                  My Faithfullest.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Count D’Alba sent to crave
                  An audience. Thou wast sleeping. I refused
                  To see him; but his messenger revealed
                  
                  To Constance his high tidings, which she poured
                  In my unwilling ears, for I so feared
                  To wake thee, that ere half her tale was told
                  I chid her from me; yet she surely said
                  The Duke thy father—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  What?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Approached the city.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Alive? Alive? Oh no! no! no! Dead! Dead!
                  The corse, the clay-cold corse!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Alive, I think;
                  But Constance—
               
               
                  Alf.
                  He will sink under this shock
                  Of hope.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Constance heard all.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Constance! What ho,
                  Constance!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  She hears thee not.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Go seek her! Fly!

                  Do I not stand
                  Here like a man of marble? Do I stir?
                  She creeps; she creeps. Thou would’st have gone and back
                  In half the time.

                  Thou may’st count hours and ages on my heart.
                  Is she not coming?

                  Julian.
                  Hark!
                  They’ve met. There are two steps; two silken gowns
                  Rustling; one whispering voice. Annabel!

                  Bert.
                  Nay, my lord,
                  She’s still beside her husband’s couch, and Paolo
                  Refused to bear the message.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Even her lacquey
                  Reads my hot love and her contempt. No matter!
                  How’s Julian?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Mending fast.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He’ll live! He’ll live!
                  She watches over him, making an air
                  With her sweet breath;—he’ll be immortal! Yet
                  If that dark tale be true—or half—Bertone,
                  Haste to the Court of Guard; seek Juan Castro,
                  A Spanish soldier; lead him home. I’ll join ye.
                  Hence! I expect the Barons, whom I summoned
                  To meet me here. Come back. See if the Princess
                  
                  Will now admit me. No! ’twould wake suspicion.
                  Hence to the Court of Guard
                   Exit Bertone
                  I think that scorn
                  Doth fan love more than beauty. Twice to-day
                  Have I paced patiently these royal halls,
                  Like some expecting needy courtier. Swell not,
                  Proud charmer, thy vast debt! Where lag these Barons?
                  Methinks this change might rouse—

                  Stumbles at these new dignities!--the King.

                  Thy worshipped Annabel chose well; she’ll be
                  A Queen.

                  Yet, my poor title, had she graced it,
                  Comes by unquestion’d sheer descent, unstain’d
                  By dark, mysterious murder. My good fathers—
                  Heaven rest their souls!—lie safely in the churchyard,
                  A simple race; whilst these high Princes—Sirs,

                  ’Tis a deep riddle, but amongst them all
                  The pretty boy is dead.

                  Melfi.
                  Noble Signors,
                  I greet you well. Thanks, D’Alba. Good Leanti
                  I joy to see those reverend locks. I never
                  Thought to behold a friendly face again.
                  And now I bring ye sorrow. Death hath been
                  Too busy; though the ripe and bearded ear
                  Escap’d his sickle—but ye know the tale;
                  Ye welcomed me as King; and I am spared
                  The painful repetition. 
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Sire, we know
                  From your own royal hand enough for joy
                  And sorrow. Death hath ta’en a goodly child
                  And spared a glorious man. But how—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My lord,
                  What wouldst thou more? Before I entered here
                  Messina’s general voice had hailed her Sovereign.
                  Lacks but the ceremonial form. ’Twere best
                  The accustomed pageant were performed even
							now,
                  Whilst ye, Sicilian Barons, strength and grace
                  Of our Sicilian realm, are here to pledge
                  Solemn allegiance. Say I sooth, Count D’Alba?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In sooth my liege, I know not. Seems to me
                  One form is wanting. Our bereaved state
                  Stands like a widow, one eye dropping tears
                  For her lost lord, the other turned with smiles
                  On her new bridegroom. But even she, the Dame
                  Of Ephesus, the buxom relict, famed
                  For quick dispatch o’er every widowed mate,
                  Woman or state—even she, before she wed,
                  Saw the good man entombed. The Funeral first;
                  And then the Coronation.

                  Scoffer! Lords,
                  The corse is missing.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Ha! Perchance he lives?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He fell, I tell thee.

                  Melfi.
                  He
                  Escaped, when I too fell.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He! Why, my liege,
                  Was there but one?
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What mean ye, Sirs? Stand off.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Cannot your Highness guess the murderer?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stand from about me, Lords! Dare ye to front
                  A King? What do ye doubt me; you, or you?
                  Dare ye to doubt me? Dare ye look a question
                  Into mine eyes? Take thy gaze off! A King
                  Demands a modester regard. Now, Sirs,
                  What do ye seek? I tell ye, the fair boy
                  Fell underneath the assassin’s sword; and I,
                  Wounded almost to death, am saved to prove
                  My subjects’ faith, to punish, to reward,
                  To reign, I tell ye, nobles. Now, who questions?
                  Who glares upon me now? What! are ye mute?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Deign to receive our homage, Sire, and pardon
                  The undesigned offence. Your Highness knows
                  Count D’Alba’s mood.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  And he knows mine. Well! Well!

                  Ye are met,
                  Barons of Sicily, in such august
                  And full assemblage as may well beseem
                  Your office, honour well yourselves and me;
                  Yet one is missing,—greatest, first and best,—
                  My son. Knows not Prince Julian that his father
                  Is here? Will he not come? Go, some one say
                  That I would see him.

                  Sire, the Prince hath lain
                  Sick of a desperate malady.

                  Melfi.
                  A stranger!
                  Say on. The Princess—?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  As I crossed the hall,
                  I met her, with her own glad step, her look
                  Of joy; and when I asked how fared Prince Julian?
                  She put her white hands into mine, with such
                  A smile, and then passed on.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Without a word?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Without a word, save the mute eloquence
                  Of that bright smile.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  aside
                  Oh ’twas enough! on him!
                  Smile on that dotard! Whilst I—aloud Why my lords,
                  Here’s a fine natural sympathy; the son
                  Sickens at the father’s wound! The very day!
                  The very hour! He must have known the deed—
                  Perchance he knows the assassin—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stop.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  My liege,
                  I speak it in his honour. Many an heir
                  Had been right glad to step into a throne
                  Just as the mounting pulse of youth beat high;—
                  A soldier too! and with a bride so fair,
                  So delicate, so fashioned for a Queen
                  By cunning nature. But he—for full surely
                  He knew—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stop. No, no, no, he knew it not!
                  He is my son.
                  Enter Calvi, followed by Julian.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  My liege, the
							Prince!
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Already!
                  Pardon me, good my lords, that I request
                  A moment’s loneliness. We have been near
                  To death since last—Have touched upon the grave,
                  And there are thoughts, which only our own hearts
                  Should hear. I pray ye pardon me. I’ll join ye
                  Within the hour for the procession.
                  Exeunt D’Alba, Leanti, Valore, Calvi &c.
               
               
                  
                  Julian!
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I know what thou would’st say. The hat
                  And sable plumes concealed—No more of it.
               
               
                  
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Oh, Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Rise, my son. Let us forget
                  What—How is Annabel? They say she has been
                  A faithful nurse. Thou hast been sick?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’m well.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Fie! when thou tremblest so.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’m well. I have been
                  Sick, brainsick, heartsick, mad. I thought—I feared—
                  It was a foretaste of the pains of Hell
                  To be so mad and yet retain the sense
                  Of that which made me so. But thou art here,
                  And I—Oh nothing but a father’s heart
                  Could ever have forgiven!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  No more. No more!
                  Thou hast not told me of thy wife.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She waits
                  
                  
                  To pay her duty.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Stay. Count D’Alba looked
                  With evil eyes upon thee, and on me
                  Cast his accustomed tauntings. Is there aught
                  
                  Amiss between ye?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He hath not yet
                  Perhaps forgotten your long rivalry
                  For Annabel’s fair hand. A dangerous meaning
                  Lurked in those bitter gibes. A dangerous foe
                  Were D’Alba. Julian, the sea breeze to thee
                  Brings health, and strength, and joy. I have an errand
                  As far as Madrid. None so well as thou
                  Can bid it speed. There shalt away to day;—
                  ’Tis thy best medicine;—thou and thy young wife.
                  The wind is fair.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To day!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Have I not said?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Send me just risen from a sick couch to Madrid!
                  Send me from home, from thee! Banish me! Father,
                  Canst thou not bear my sight?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I cannot bear
                  
                  Contention. Must I needs remind thee, Julian,
                  I have also been ill?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ll go to day.
                  How pale he is! I had not dared before
                  To look upon his face. I’ll go to day.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  This very hour?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  This very hour.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My son!
                  Now call thy—yet a moment. Where’s the boy—
                  He shall aboard with thee—thy pretty page?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The King? Mean’st thou the King?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  He, whom thou call’st—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Wilt thou not say the King?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Young Theodore.
                  Hearken, Prince Julian! I am glad, right glad
                  Of what hath chanced. ’Twas well to bring him hither,
                  
                  And keep him at thy side. He shall away
                  To Spain with thee, that Theodore—Forget
                  All other titles. He’ll be glad of this.
                  A favourite page, a spoilt and petted boy,
                  To lie in summer gardens, in the shade
                  Of orange groves, whose pearly blossoms fall
                  Amidst his clustering curls, and to his lute
                  Sing tenderest ditties,—such his happy lot;
                  Whilst I—Go, bring thy wife.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He is the King.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Call lady Annabel.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The King, I say,
                  The rightful King, the only King! I’ll shed
                  The last drop in my veins for King Alfonso.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Once I forgave thee. But to beard me thus,
                  And for a weak and peevish youth, a faintling,
                  A boy of a girl’s temper; one who shrinks
                  Trembling and crouching at a look, a word,
                  
                  A lifted finger, like a beaten hound.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Alas! poor boy! he hath no other friend
                  Since thou, who should’st defend him,—Father, Father,
                  Three months have scarcely passed since thy dear brother,
                  (Oh, surely thou lovedst him!) with the last words
                  He ever spake, besought thy guardian care
                  Of his fair child. Next upon me he turned
                  His dying eyes, quite speechless then, and thou—
                  I could not speak, for poor Alfonso threw
                  Himself upon my breast, with such a
							gush
                  Of natural grief, I had no utterance—
                  But thou didst vow for both protection, faith,
                  Allegiance; thou didst swear so fervently,
                  So deeply, that the spirit flew to Heaven
                  Smiling. I’ll keep that oath.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Even if again thy sword—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Urge not that thought on me. ’Tis a fire
                  Here in my heart, my brain. Bethink thee, Father,
                  Soldier or statesman, thine is the first name
                  
                  Of Sicily, the General, Regent, Prince,
                  The unmatch’d in power, the unapproach’d in fame;
                  What could that little word a King do more
                  For thee?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  That little word! Why that is fame,
                  And power and glory! That shall fill the world,
                  Lend a whole age its name, and float along
                  The stream of time, with such a buoyancy,
                  As shall endure when palaces and tombs
                  Are swept away like dust. That little word!
                  Beshrew thy womanish heart that cannot feel
                  Its spell!
                  Guns and shouts are heard without.
                  Hark! Hark! The guns! I feel it now.
                  I am proclaimed. Before I entered here
                  ’Twas known throughout the city that I lived,
                  And the boy-king was dead. 
                  Guns, bells, and shouts again.
                  Hark, King Rugiero!
                  Dost hear the bells, the shouts? Oh ’tis a
						            	proud
                  And glorious feeling thus at once to live
                  Within a thousand bounding hearts, to hear
                  The strong out-gushing of that present fame
                  
                  For whose uncertain dim futurity
                  Men toil, and slay, and die! Without a crime—
                  I thank thee still for that—Without a crime—
                  For he’ll be happier—I am a King.
                  Shouts again.
                  Dost thou not hear Long live the King Rugiero?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The shout is weak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Augment it by thy voice.
                  Would the words choak Prince Julian? Cannot he
                  Wish long life to his Father?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Live, my Father!
                  Long live the Duke of Melfi!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Live the King!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Long live the King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Now, by Heaven,
                  Thou art still brainsick. There is a contagion
                  In the soft dreamy nature of that child,
                  That thou, a soldier—I was overproud
                  Of thee and thy young fame. That lofty brow
                  
                  Seem’d form’d to wear a crown. Chiefly for thee—
                  Where is the Page?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh Father, once
							again
                  Take pity on us all! For me! For me!
                  Thou hast always been to me the kindest, fondest—
                  Preventing all my wishes— I’ll not reason,
                  I’ll not contend with thee. Here at thy feet,
                  Prostrate in spirit as in form, I cry
                  For mercy! Save me from despair! from sin!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Unmanly,  rise! lest in that slavish posture
                  I treat thee as a slave.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Strike an thou wilt,
                  Thy words pierce deeper, to the very core!
                  Strike an thou wilt; but hear me. Oh my Father,
                  I do conjure thee, by that name, by all
                  The boundless love it guerdons, spare my soul
                  This bitterness!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’ll reign.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, reign indeed;
                  Rule over mightier realms; be conqueror
                  Of crowned passions; king of thy own mind.
                  I’ve ever loved thee as a son,, do this
                  And I shall worship thee. I will cling to thee;
                  Thou shalt not shake me off.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Go to; thou art mad.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet; but thou may’st make me so.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’ll make thee
                  The heir of a fair crown.
               
               
                  Julian. 
                  Not all the powers
                  Of all the earth can force upon my brow
                  That heritage of guilt. Cannot I die?
                  But that were happiness. I’d rather drag
                  A weary life beneath the silent rule
                  Of the stern Trappist, digging my own grave,
                  Myself a living corse, cut off from the sweet
                  And natural kindness that man shews to man;
                  I’d rather hang, a hermit, on the steep
                  
                  Of horrid Etna, between snow and fire;
                  Rather than sita crown’d and honour’d prince
                  Guarded by children, tributaries, friends,
                  On an usurper’s throne.
               
               Guns without.
               
                  Melfi.
                  I must away.
                  We’ll talk of this anon. Where is the
							boy.
               
               
                  Julian. 
                  Safe.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Trifle not with my impatience, Julian;
                  Produce the child. Howe’er thou may deny
                  Allegiance to the king, obey thy father.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I had a father.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  But he gave up
                  Faith, loyalty, and honour, and pure fame,
                  And his own son.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My son!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I loved him once,
                  And dearly. Still too dearly! But with all
                  That burning, aching, passionate old love
                  
                  Wrestling within my breast; even face to face;
                  Those eyes upon me; and that trembling hand
                  Thrilling my very heartstrings—Take it off!
                  In mercy, take it off!--Still I renounce thee.
                  Thou hast no son. I have no father. Go
                  Down to a childless grave.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Even from the grave
                  A father’s curse may reach thee, clinging to thee
                  Cold as a dead man’s shroud, shadowing thy days,
                  Haunting thy dreams, and hanging, a thick
						            	cloud,
                  ’Twixt thee and Heaven. Then, when perchance thine own
                  Small prattling pretty ones shall climb thy knee
                  And bid thee bless them, think of thy dead father,
                  And groan as thou dost now.
                  Guns again.
                  Hark! ’tis the hour!
                  I must away. Back to thy chamber, son,
                  And chuse if I shall curse thee. 
               
               Exit Melfi.
               
                  Julian.
                  
                  Did he curse me?
                  Did he? Am I that withered, blasted wretch?
                  Is that the fire that burns my brain? Not yet!
                  Oh, do not curse me yet! He’s gone. The boy!
                  The boy!
               
               Rushes out.
               END OF THE SECOND ACT
            
         
         
         
            ACT III
            
               SCENE.
               A Magnificent Cathedral. A Gothic Monument in the Foreground, with Steps round it, and the Figure of an old Warrior on the top.
               D’Alba, Leanti, Valore, Calvi, and other nobles.
               
                  Calvi.
                  Where stays the King?
               
               
                  Leanti
                  He’s robing to assume
                  The Crown.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  What a gloom reigns in the Cathedral!
                  Where are the people, who should make and grace
                  This pageant?
               
               
                  Valore.
                  ’Tis too sudden.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Saw ye not
                  How coldly, as the slow procession moved,
                  Men’s eyes were fixed upon him? Silently
                  We passed amid dull silence. I could hear
                  The chink of money, which the heralds flung,
                  Reverberate on the pavement. They, who stooped
                  To gather up the coin, looked on the impress
                  Of young Alfonso, sighed and shook their heads
                  
                  As ’twere his funeral.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Methinks this place
                  The general tomb of his high line doth cry
                  Shame on us! The mute citizens do mourn him
                  Better than we.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Therefore the gates are closed,
                  And none but peers of Sicily may pass
                  The guarded doors.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Where is Prince Julian?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sick
                  Here comes the Mighty One, and the great Prelates
                  That shall anoint his haughty brow; ’tis bent
                  With a stern joy.
               
               Enter Melfi, in Royal Robes, preceded by Nobles,
								Officers, &c. bearing the Crown, Archbishop, Bishops,
								&c.
               
                  Melfi.
                  No! To no tapered shrine.
                  Here, reverend Fathers, here! This is my altar:
                  The tomb of my great ancestor, who first
                  Won from the Paynim this Sicilian crown,
                  And wore it gloriously; whose name I bear
                  
                  As I will bear his honour’d sceptre. Here,
                  At this most kingly altar, will I plight
                  My vow to Sicily, the nuptial vow
                  That links my fate to her’s. Here I’ll receive
                  Her Barons’ answering faith. Hear me, thou shade
                  Of great Rugiero, whilst I swear to guard
                  With heart and hand the realm thy valour won,
                  The laws thy wisdom framed—brave legacy
                  To prince and people! to defend their rights,
                  To rule in truth and justice, peacefully,
                  If peace may be; and with the awful arm
                  Of lawful power to sweep the oppressor off
                  From thy blest Isle; to be the Peasants’ King—
                  Nobles, hear that!--the Peasants’ King and yours!
                  Look down, Ancestral Spirit, on my oath,
                  And sanctify and bless it! Now the crown.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  What noise is that at the gate?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Crown me, I say.
               
               
                  Archb.
                  ’Tis fallen! Save us from the ill omen!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Save us
                  From thy dull hands, old dotard! Thou a Priest,
                  And tremble at the touch of power! Give me
                  The crown.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  It fits thee not.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Give me the crown,
                  And with a steady grasp it shall endue
                  These throbbing brows that burn till they are bound
                  With that bright diadem.
                  
                  Enter Julian and Alfonso.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Stop. Place it here!
                  This is the King! the real, the only King!
                  The living King Alfonso!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Out, foul traitor!
                  ’Tis an impostor.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Look on him, Count D’Alba!
                  Calvi, Valore, look! Ye know him well.
                  And ye that never saw him, know ye not
                  His father’s lineaments? Remove thy hand
                  From that fair forehead. ’Tis the pallid brow
                  Bent with pensiveness, the dropping eyelid,
                  The womanish changing cheek—his very self!
                  Look on him. Do ye know him? Do ye own
                  Your King?
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  ’Tis he.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  The boy
							himself!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Now place
                  
                  The crown upon his head; and hear me swear
                  Low at his feet, as subject, kinsman, Prince,
                  Allegiance.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Rise, dear Cousin.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father, kneel,
                  Kneel here with me thou, his first subject, thou
                  The guardian of the state, kneel first, and vow
                  Thy princely fealty.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Hence, abject slave!
                  And thou, young minion—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  to Alf.
                  Fear not. Father, kneel!
                  Look where thou art. This is no place, my lord,
                  To dally with thy duty: underneath
                  Thy fathers’ sleep; above their banners wave
                  Heavily. Death is round about us. Death
                  And Fame. Have they no voice for thee? Not one,
                  Of one long storied line but lived and died
                  A pure and faithful Knight, and left his son
                  Honour—proud heritage! I am thine heir,
                  And I demand that bright inheritance
                  Unstained, undimmed. Kneel, I implore thee! I,
                  Thy son.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Off, cursed viper!
                  Off, ere I hurl thee on the stones!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ve done
                  My duty. Was it not my duty?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian,
                  Sit here by me; here on the
							steps.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Again
                  We must demand of thee, my Lord of Melfi,
                  How chanced this tale of murder? Here’s our Prince,
                  Safe and unhurt. But where’s the Assassin? Where
                  The regicide? Where he that wounded thee?
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Pointing to Julian
                  Demand of him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Where be these murderers?
                  Art sure thou saw’st them, Duke? Or was’t a freak
                  Of the deft Fay Morgana? Didst thou
							feel
                  The trenchant blade? Or, was the hurt thou talk’st of
                  A fairy wound, a phantasm? Once again
                  I warn thee, speak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Demand Prince Julian, Sir,
                  This work is his.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He speaks not. Little King,
                  What say’st thou?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian saved me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Saved! From whom?
                  From what!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  A king should have no memory
                  But for good deeds. My lords, an it so please you,
                  We’ll to the Palace. I’ll not wear to-day
                  This crown. Some fitting season; but not now.
                  I’m weary. Let us home.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Aye, take him hence.
                  Home with him, Count Valore. Stay by him
                  Till I come to ye. Leave him not. Nay, Calvi,
                  Remain. Hence with the boy.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Cousin Julian,
                  Wilt thou not go with us?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I’ve done my duty.
                  Was’t not my duty? But look there! look there!
                  I cannot go with thee. I am his now.
                  All his.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Uncle—
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Away, bright spotted worm—
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  What, ho! the guard!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My lord, where Julian is
                  I need no guard. Question no more of this,
                  But follow us.
                  Exeunt Alfonso, Valore, and other nobles.
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I do contemn myself
                  That I hold silence. Warriors, kinsmen, friends,
                  Barons of Sicily, the valiant princes
                  Of this most fertile and thrice famous Isle,
                  Hear me! What yonder crafty Count hath dared,
                  With subtle question and
					          		derisive smile,
                  To slide into a meaning, is as true
                  As he is false. I would be King; I’d reign
                  Over fair Sicily; I’d call myself
                  Your Sovereign, Princes; thine, Count D’Alba, thine,
                  Calvi, and old Leanti—we were comrades
                  Many a year in the rough path of war.
                  And now ye know me all. I’ll be a King
                  Fit for this warlike nation, which brooks sway
                  Only of men. Yon slight fair boy is born
                  With a woman’s heart. Let him go tell his beads
                  For us and for our kingdom, I’ll be King.
                  I’ll lend unto that title such a name,
                  As shall enchase this bauble with one blaze
                  Of honour. I’ll lead on to glory, lords,
                  And ye shall shine in the brightness of my fame
                  
                  As planets round the sun. What say ye?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Calvi, &c.
                  Never!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Say thou, Leanti, thou’rt a soldier
                  Worthy of the name,—a brave one! What say’st thou?
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  If young Alfonso—
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Peace. Why this is well.
                  This morning I received a tale—I’m not
                  An over-believer in man’s excellence;
                  I know that in this slippery path of life
                  The firmest foot may fail; that there have been
                  Ere now ambitious generals, grasping heirs,
                  Unnatural kinsmen, foul usurpers, murderers!--
                  I know that man is frail, and might have fallen
                  Tho’ Eve had never lived,—Albeit I own
                  The smiling mischief’s potency. But this,
                  This tale was made up of such several sins,
                  All of them devilish, treason, treachery,
                  
                  And pitiless cruelty made murder pale
                  With their red shame,—I doubt not readily
                  When man and guilt are joined—but this the common
                  And general sympathy that links our kind
                  Forbade to believe. Yet now before ye all,
                  His peers and mine, before the vacant throne
                  He sought to usurp, before the crown that fell
                  As conscious from his brow, I do arraign
                  Rugiero, Duke of Melfi, General, Peer,
                  Regent and Prince, of Treason.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Treason! D’Alba.
                  We quarrel not for words. Let these but follow
                  And bold emprise shall bear a happier name.
                  Sicilians, have ye lost your Island spirit?
                  Barons, is your ancient bravery tamed down
                  By this vain scoffer? I’ll to the people. They
                  Love their old soldier.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Stop. Duke, I arraign thee
                  Of murder; planned, designed, attempted murder,
                  Though incomplete, on the thrice sacred person
                  
                  Of young Alfonso, kinsman, ward, and King.
                  Wilt thou defend this too? Was’t a brave deed
                  To draw the assassin’s sword on that poor child?
                  Seize him!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Come near who dares! Where be thy proofs?
                  Where be thy witnesses?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  There’s one. Prince Julian,
                  Rouse thee!He sits erect and motionless
                  As yon ancestral image. Doth he breathe?
                  Rouse thee, and answer, as before thy God,
                  As there is truth in Heaven. Didst thou not see
                  Thy father’s sword at young Alfonso’s breast?
                  Lay not the boy, already dead with fear,
                  At his false guardian’s feet? Answer!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Aye, speak,
                  Prince Julian! Dost thou falter now? On, on,
                  And drive the dagger home! On, on, I say.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  We wait your Highness’ answer.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Which among ye
                  Dares question me? What are ye, Sirs?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  The States of Sicily.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The States! Without a head!
                  Without a King! Without a Regent! States!
                  The States! Are ye the States that ’gainst all form
                  Of justice or of guardian law drive on
                  To bloody trial, him your Greatest? Here, too!
                  Here! Will ye build up scaffolds in your churches?
                  And turn grave priests to beadsmen? I’ll not answer.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  The rack may force thee.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He but smiles. Convey
                  The Duke to the Hall of Justice. We shall follow.
                  Go summon Juan Castro thither. Hence!
                  Why loiter ye?
               
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  A word with thee, Prince Julian.
                  I pray ye, listen, ’tis no treason, lords.
                  I would but say, finish thy work. Play well
                  The part that thou hast chosen. Cast aside
                  All filial yearnings. Be a gallant foe.
                  Rush onward through the fight. Trample me down.
                  Tread on my neck. Be perfect in that quality
                  Which thou call’st justice. Quell thy womanish weakness.
                  Let me respect the enemy, whom once
                  I thought my Son.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Once, Father!
                  
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I’m no Father!
                  Rouse not my soul to curse thee! Tempt me not
                  To curse thy Mother—She whom once I deemed
                  A saint in purity; Be resolute,
                  Falter not with them. Lie not.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Did I ever?
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Finish thy work. On, soldiers!
                  Exit Melfi, guarded.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Answer, Prince!
                  The Duke, as thou hast heard, disclaims thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Dare not
                  A man of ye say that. I am his son—
                  Tremble lest my sword should prove me so;—a part
                  Of his own being. He gave me this life,
                  These senses, these affections. The quick blood
                  That knocks so strongly at my heart is his—
                  Would I might spill it for him! Had ye no fathers,
                  Have ye no sons, that ye would train men up
                  In parricide? I will not answer ye.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  This passion is thy answer. Could’st thou say
                  No; in that simple word were more comprised
                  Than in a world of fiery eloquence.
                  Canst thou not utter No? ’Tis short and easy,
                  The first sound that a stuttering babe will lisp
                  To his fond nurse,—yet thy tongue stammers at it!
                  I ask him if his father be at once
                  Traitor and Murderer, and he cannot say,
                  No!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Subtle blood-thirsty fiend! I’ll answer
                  To nought that thou canst ask. Murderer! The king
                  Lives. Seek of him. One truth I’ll tell thee, D’Alba,
                  And then the record of that night shall pass
                  Down to the grave in silence. But one sword
                  Was stained with blood in yonder glen—’twas mine!
                  I am the only guilty. This I swear
                  Before the all-seeing God, whose quenchless gaze
                  Pierced through that twilight hour. Now condemn
                  The Duke of Melfi an ye dare! I’ll speak
                  No more on this foul question.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Thou the guilty?
                  Thou!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have said it.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I had heard a tale—
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  This must be sifted.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In that twilight hour
                  A mortal eye beheld them. An old Spaniard,
                  One of the guard—By Heaven it is a tale
                  So bloody, so unnatural, man may scarce
                  Believe it!
               
               
                  Leanti
                  And the king still lives.
               
               
                  D’Alba
                  Why, ’tis
                  A mystery. Let’s to the Hall of Justice
                  And hear this soldier. Sir, they are ambitious,
                  Father & son—We can pass judgment there,
                  This is no place;—Leanti, more ambitious
                  Than thou canst guess.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, by a thousand fold!
                  I am an eaglet born, and can drink in
                  The sunlight, when the blinking owls go darkling,
                  Dazzled and blinded by the day. Ambitious!
                  I have had day dreams would have shamed the visions
                  Of that great Master of the world, who wept
                  For other worlds to conquer. I’d have lived
                  An age of sinless glory, and gone down
                  Storied and epitaphed and chronicled,
                  To the very end of time. Now—But I still
                  May suffer bravely, may die as a Prince,
                  A Man. Ye go to judgment. Lords, remember
                  I am the only guilty.
               
               
                  Calvi
                  We must needs
                  On such confession, give you into charge
                  A prisoner. Ho! Captain.
               
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Goes he with us?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  No; for the hall is near, and they are best
                  
                  Questioned apart. Walk by me, good Leanti,
                  And I will shew thee why.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Is’t possible
                  That Julian stabb’d his father?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  No. Thou saw’st
                  They met as friends; no! no!
                  Exeunt Calvi and other Lords
                  Enter Annabel .
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where is he? Where?
                  Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Fair Princess—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stay me not. My Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Oh, how she sinks her head upon his arm!
                  How her curls kiss his cheek! and her white hand
                  Lies upon his! The cold and sluggish husband!
                  He doth not clasp that loveliest hand, which nature
                  Fashioned to gather roses, or to hold
                  Bunches of bursting grapes.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Count D’Alba, see,
                  We are alone. Wilt thou not come?
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Anon.
                  Now he hath seized her hand, hath dared to grasp,
                  He shall not hold it long.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  They’ll wait us, Count.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  That white hand shall be mine.
                  Exeunt D’Alba and Leanti
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My Annabel,
                  Why art thou here?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  They said—I was a fool
                  That believed them!—Constance said she heard a cry,
                  Down with the Melfi! and the rumour ran
                  That there had been a fray, that thou wast slain.
                  But thou art safe, my Julian?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  As thou seest.
                  Thou art breathless still.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Aye. I flew through the streets,
                  Piercing the crowds like light. I was a fool;
                  But thou had’st left me on a sudden, bearing
                  
                  The young Alfonso with thee, high resolve
                  Fixed in thine eye. I knew not—Love is
									fearful;
                  And I have learnt to fear.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Thou tremblest still.
               
               
                  Annabel.
                  The Church is cold and lonely; and that seat,
                  At the foot of yon grim warrior, all too damp
                  For thee. I like not thus to see thee, Julian,
                  Upon a tomb. Thou must submit thee still
                  To thy poor nurse. Home! By the way thou’lt tell
									me
                  What hath befallen. Where is Alfonso?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Say
                  The King! the rightful, the acknowledged King!
                  Annabel, this rude stone’s effigy
                  Of the founder of our line; the gallant chief
                  Who swept away the Saracen, and quelled
                  Fierce civil broils; and, when the people’s choice
                  Crowned him, lived guardian of their rights, and died
                  Wept by them as a father. And methinks
                  To-day I do not shame my ancestor;
                  I dare to sit here at his feet, and feel
                  He would not spurn his son. Thou dost not grieve
                  To lose a crown, my fairest?
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Oh no! no!
                  I’m only proud of thee. Thy fame’s my crown.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Not fame but conscience is the enduring crown,
                  And wearing that impearled, why to lose fame
                  Or life were nothing.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  Where’s thy father, Julian?
                  Forgive me, I have pained thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No. The pang
                  Is mastered. Where? He is a prisoner
                  Before the States. I am a prisoner here.
                  These are my guards. Be calmer, Sweetest. Rend not
                  This holy place with shrieks.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  They seek thy life!
                  They’ll sentence thee! They’ll kill thee! No! they shall not,
                  Unless they kill me first. What crime—O God,
                  
                  
                  To talk of crime and thee!--What falsest
						            	charge
                  Dare they to bring?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Somewhat of yon sad night
                  They know.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where’s Theodore? The page? The King?
                  Doth he accuse thee too?
                  
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Poor gentle Cousin!
                  He is as innocent as thou.
               
               
                  Ann.
                  I’ll fetch him.
                  We’ll go together to the States. We’ll save thee.
                  We, feeble though we be, woman and boy,
                  We’ll save thee. Hold me not!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Where would’st thou go?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  To the States.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  And there?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  I’ll tell the truth, the truth,
                  The irresistible truth! Let go. A moment
                  May cost thy life,—our lives. Nothing but truth,
                  That’s all thy cause can need. Let go.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  And he,
                  My father?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  What’s a thousand such as he,
                  To thee, my husband! But he shall be safe.
                  He is thy father. I’ll say nought can harm him.
                  He was ever kind to me! I’ll pray for him.
                  
                  Nay, an thou fear’st me, Julian, I’ll not speak
                  One word; I’ll only kneel before them all,
                  Lift up my hands, and pray in my inmost heart,
                  As I pray to God.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My loving wife, to Him
                  Pray, to Him only. Leave me not, my dearest;
                  There is a peace around us in this pause,
                  This interval of torture. I’m content
                  And strong to suffer. Be thou—
                  Enter D’Alba, Calvi, Leanti and Nobles
                  Ha! returned
                  Already! This is quick. But I’m prepared.
                  The sentence!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Tell it not! Ye are his Judges.
                  Ye have the power of life and death. Your words
                  Are fate. Oh speak not yet! Listen to me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Aye; a long summer day! What would’st thou?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Save him!
                  Save him!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He shall not die.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now bless thee, D’Alba!
                  Bless thee! He’s safe! He’s free!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Once more I ask
                  His doom, for that is mine. If ye have dared,
                  In mockery of justice, to arraign
                  And sentence your great Ruler, with less pause
                  Than a petty thief taken in the manner, what’s
                  Our doom?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sir, our great ruler (we that love not
                  Law’s tedious circumstance may thank him) spared
                  All trial by confession. He avowed
                  Treason and regicide; and all that thou
                  Hadst said or might say, he avouched unheard
                  For truth, then cried; as thou hast done, for judgment,
                  For death.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I can die too.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  A milder doom
                  Unites ye. We have spared the royal blood.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Only the blood. Estates and honours all
                  Are forfeit to the King; the assembled states
                  Banish ye; the most holy Church declares ye
                  Beneath her ban. This is your sentence, Sir.
                  A Herald waits to read it in the streets
                  
                  Before ye, and from out the city gate
                  To thrust ye, outlawed, excommunicate,
                  Infamous amongst men. Ere noon to-morrow
                  Ye must depart from Sicily; on pain
                  Of death to ye the outlaws, death to all
                  That harbour ye, death to whoe’er shall give
                  Food, shelter, comfort, speech. So pass ye forth
                  In infamy!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Eternal infamy
                  Rest on your heads, false judges! Outlawed! Banished!
                  Bereft of all state and title! Thou art still
                  Best of the good, greatest amongst the great,
                  My Julian! Must they die that give thee food
                  And rest and comfort? I shall comfort thee,
                  I thy true wife! I’ll never leave thee. Never!
                  We’ll walk together to the gate, my hand
                  In thine, as lovers. Let’s set forth. We’ll go
                  Together.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye; but not to-night. I’ll meet thee
                  To-morrow at the harbour.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No! no! no!
                  
                  I will not leave thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Cling not thus. She trembles.
                  She cannot walk. Brave Sir, we have been comrades;
                  There is a pity in thine eye, which well
                  Beseems a soldier. Take this weeping lady
                  To King Alfonso. Tell the royal boy
                  One, who was once his Cousin and his friend,
                  Commends her to him. Go. To-morrow, dearest,
                  We’ll meet again. Now for the sentence. Lords,
                  I question not your power. I submit
                  To all, even to this shame. Be quick! be quick!
               
               Exeunt.
               END OF THE THIRD ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT IV.
            
               Scene 1
               An Apartment in the Royal Palace.
               D’Alba, Bertone.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I’ve parted them at last. The livelong night
                  The little King lay, like a page, before
                  Her chamber door; and ever as he heard
                  A struggling sigh within, he cried, alas!
                  And echoed back her moan, and uttered words
                  Of comfort. Happy boy.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  But he is gone
                  Towards the gate: be sure to meet Prince Julian.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  For that I care not, so that I secure
                  The vision that once flitted from my grasp
                  And vanished like a rainbow.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Yet is Julian
                  Still dangerous.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Why after noon to-day—
                  And see the sun’s already high!--he dies
                  If he be found in Sicily. Take thou
                  Two resolute comrades to pursue his steps,
                  
                  Soon as the time be past. Didst thou not hear
                  The proclamation? Know’st thou where he bides?
                  And Melfi?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Good, my lord, ’tis said the Duke
                  Is dead.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Dead!
               
               
                  Bert.
                  Certain ’tis that yesternight
                  He walked from out the Judgment Hall like one
                  Dreaming, with eyes that saw not, ears that heard
                  No sound, staggering and tottering like old age
                  Or infancy. And when the kingly robe
                  Was plucked from him, and he forced from the gate,
                  A deep wound in his side burst forth; the blood
                  Welled like a fountain.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And he died?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  He fell
                  Fainting; and Julian, who had tended him
                  Silently, with a spirit so absorbed
                  His own shame seemed unfelt, fell on his neck
                  Shrieking like maddening woman. There we left him,
                  
                  And there ’tis said he hath outwatched the night.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  There on the ground?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  So please you.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Thou hast known
                  A softer couch, Prince Julian. Is the litter
                  Prepared? And the old groom?
               
               
                  Bert.
                  My lord, he waits
                  Your pleasure.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Call him hither.
                  Exit Bertone.
                  Blood welled out
                  From a deep wound! Said old Leanti sooth?
                  No matter! Either way he’s guilty.
                  Re-enter Bertone with Renzi.
                  Ha!
                  A reverend knave. Wast thou Prince Julian’s huntsman?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  An please you, Sir, I was.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Dost know the Princess?—
                  Doth she know thee?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  Full well, my Lord. I tended
                  Prince Julian’s favourite greyhound. It was strange
                  How Lelia loved my lady,—the poor fool
                  Hath pined for her this week past,—and my lady
                  Loved Lelia. She would stroke her glossy head,
                  And talk of Lelia’s beauty, Lelia’s speed,
                  Till I was weary.
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And the angel deemed
                  This slave as faithful as her dog! The better.
                  Dost thou love ducats, Renzi?
                  Tossing him a purse.
                  Canst thou grace
                  A lie with tongue and look and action?
               
               
                  Renzi.
                  Aye.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Go to the Princess; say thy master sent
							thee
                  To guide her to him, or the young Alfonso,—
                  Use either name, or both. Spare not for tears,
                  Or curses. Lead her to the litter; see
                  That Constance follows not. Bertone’ll gain
                  Admittance for thee—Go.
                  Exit Renzi.
                  Bertone seek me
                  A supple churchman;—Know’st thou any? One
                  Not scrupulous; one who loves gold, and laughs
                  At conscience. Bring him to me. I must hasten
                  Silently home. Let not the Princess guess
                  That I have left the palace.
               
               
                  Bert.
                  No, my Lord.
               
               Exeunt severally.
               
            
            
               SCENE II
               The Country just without the gates of Messina. A hilly back Ground.
               Melfi, lying on the Stage, Julian.
               
                  Julian.
                  He wakes! He is not dead! I am not yet
                  A parricide. I dare not look on him;
                  I dare not speak.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Water! my throat is scorched.
                  Exit Julian.
                  My tongue cleaves to my mouth. Water! Will none
                  
                  
                  Go fetch me water? Am I here alone?
                  Here on the bloody ground, as on that night—
                  Am I there still? No! I remember now.
                  Yesterday I was King; to-day, I’m nothing;
                  Cast down by my own son; stabbed in my fame;
                  Branded and done to death; an outlaw where
                  I ruled! He, whom I loved with such a pride,
                  With such a fondness, hath done this; and I,
                  I have not strength to drag me to his presence
                  That I might rain down curses on his head,
                  Might blast him with a look.
               
               
               Enter Julian.
               
                  Julian.
                  Here’s water. Drink!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What voice is that? Why dost thou shroud thy face?
                  Dost shame to shew thyself? Who art thou?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Drink.
                  I pray thee drink.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Is’t poison?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Tis the pure
                  And limpid gushing of a natural spring
                  Close by yon olive ground. A little child,
                  Who stood beside the fount, watching the bright
                  And many-coloured pebbles, as they seemed
                  To dance in the bubling water, filled for me
                  Her beechen cup, with her small innocent hand,
                  And bade our Lady bless the draught! Oh drink!
                  Have faith in such a blessing!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Thou should’st bring
                  Nothing but poison. Hence, accursed cup!
                  
                  I’ll perish in my thirst. I know thee, Sir.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Father!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I have no son. I had one once,
                  
                  A gallant gentleman; but he—What, Sir,
                  Didst thou never hear of that Sicilian Prince,
                  Who made the fabulous tale of Greece a truth,
                  And slew his father? The old Laius fell
                  At once, unknowing and unknown; but this
                  New Œdipus, he stabbed and stabbed and stabbed,
                  And the poor wretch cannot die.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I think my heart
                  Is iron that it breaks not.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I should curse him—
                  And yet—Dost thou not know that I’m an outlaw,
                  Under the ban? They stand in danger, Sir,
                  That talk to me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I am an outlaw too.
                  Thy fate is mine. Our sentence is alike.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What! have they banished thee?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I should have gone,
                  In very truth, I should have gone with thee,
                  Aye to the end of the world.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What banish thee!
                  Oh, foul ingratitude! Weak changeling boy!
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He knows it not. Father, this banishment
                  Came as a comfort to me, set me free
                  From warring duties and fatiguing cares,
                  And left me wholly thine. We shall be happy;
                  For she goes with us, who will prop thy steps,
                  As once the maid of Thebes, Antigone,
                  In that old tale. Chuse thou whatever land,—
                  All are alike to us. But pardon me!
                  Say thou hast pardoned me!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  My virtuous son!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh thanks to thee and Heaven! He sinks; he’s faint;
                  His lips wax pale. I’ll seek the spring once more:
                  ’Tis thirst.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  What music’s that?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I hear none.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Hark!
               
               
                  Julian
                  Thou art weak and dizzy.
               
               
                  Melfi
                  Angels of the air,
                  Cherub and Seraph sometimes watch around
                  The dying, and the mortal sense, at pause
                  ’Twixt life and death, doth drink in a faint echo
                  Of heavenly harpings?
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have heard so.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Aye;
                  But they were just men, Julian! They were holy.
                  They were not traitors.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Strive against these thoughts—
                  Thou wast a brave man, Father!--fight against them,
                  As ’gainst the Paynims thy old foes. He grows
                  Paler and paler. Water from the spring;
                  Or generous wine;—I saw a cottage near.
                  Rest thee, dear Father, till I come.
               
               Exit Julian.
               
                  Melfi.
                  Again
                  That music! It is mortal; it draws nearer.
                  No. But if men should pass, must I lie here
                  Like a crushed adder? Here in the highway
                  Trampled beneath their feet?—So! So! I’ll crawl
                  To yonder bank. Oh that it were the deck
                  Of some great Admiral, and I alone
                  Boarding amidst a hundred swords! the breach
                  Of some strong citadel, and I the first
                  
                  To mount in the cannon’s mouth! I was brave once.
                  Oh for the common undistinguished death
                  Of battle, pressed by horse’s heels, or crushed
                  By falling towers! And thing but to lie
                  Here like a leper!
               
               Enter Alfonso, Valore, and Calvi.
               
                  Alfon.
                  ’Tis the spot where Julian—
                  And yet I see him not. I’ll pause awhile;
                  ’Tis likely he’ll return. I’ll wait.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  My liege,
                  You’re sad to day.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  I have good cause to be so.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Nay, nay, cheer up.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  Didst thou not tell me, Sir,
                  That my poor Uncle’s banished, outlawed, laid
                  Under the church’s ban?
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  He would have slain
                  His Sovereign.
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  I ne’er said it. Yesterday
                  I found you at his feet. Oh, would to Heaven
                  That crown were on his head, and I—What’s that?
               
               
                  Valore.
                  The moaning wind.
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  He was a traitor, Sire,
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  He was my kinsman still. And Julian! Julian!
                  My Cousin Julian! he who saved my life,
                  Whose only crime it was to be too good,
                  Too great, too well beloved,—to banish him!
                  To tear him from my arms!
               
               
                  Calvi.
                  Sire, he confessed—
               
               
                  Alfonso.
                  Ye should have questioned me. Sirs, I’m a boy,
                  A powerless, friendless boy, whose name is used
                  To cover foul oppression. If I live
                  To grasp a sword—but ye will break my heart
                  Before that hour. Whence come those groans?
										Seeing Melfi. My Uncle
                  
                  Stretched on the ground, and none to tend thee! Rest
                  Thy head upon my arm. Where’s Julian? Sure
                  I thought to find him with thee. Nay, be still;
                  Strive not to move.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  I fain would kneel to thee
                  For pardon.
               
               
                  Calvi
                  Listen not, my liege. The States
                  Sentenced the Duke of Melfi; thou hast not
                  The power to pardon. Leave him to his fate.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  ’Twere best your Highness came with us.
                  
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Avoid
                  The place! Leave us, cold, courtly lords! Avoid
                  My sight! Leave us, I say. Send instant succour,
                  Food, water, wine, and men with hearts, if courts
                  May breed such. Leave us.
               
               Exeunt Calvi and Valore.
               
                  Melfi.
                  Gallant boy!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Alas!
                  I have no power.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  For all I need thou hast.
                  Give me but six feet of Sicilian earth,
                  And thy sweet pardon.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Talk not thus. I’ll grow
                  At once into a man, into a king,
                  And they shall tremble, and turn pale with fear.
                  Who now have dared—
                  Enter Julian.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Here’s water. Ha!
                  Alfonso! I thought Pity had been dead.
                  
                  I craved a little wine, for the dear love
                  Of Heaven, for a poor dying man; and all
                  Turned from my prayer. Drink, 
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I have sent
                  For succour.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Gentle heart!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  The time is past.
                  Music again.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye; ’tis a shepherd’s pipe
                  From yonder craggy mountain. How it swings
                  Upon the wind, now pausing, now renewed,
                  Regular as a bell.
               
               
                  Melf.
                  A passing bell.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Cast off these heavy thoughts.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Turn me.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  He bleeds!
                  The blood wells out.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  It eases me.
               
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He sinks!
                  He dies! Off! he’s my father. Rest on me.
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Bless thee.
               
               
                  Julian
                  Oh, no! no! no! I cannot bear
                  Thy blessing. Twice to stab, and twice forgiven—
                  Oh curse me rather!
               
               
                  Melfi.
                  Bless ye both!
                  Dies.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  He’s dead,
                  And surely he died penitent. That thought
                  Hath in it a deep comfort. The freed spirit
                  Gushed out in a full tide of pardoning love.
                  He blest us both, my Julian; even me
                  As I had been his son. We’ll pray for him
                  Together, and thy Annabel shall join
                  Her purest orisons. I left her stretched
                  In a deep slumber. All night long she watched
                  And wept for him and thee; but now she sleeps.
                  Shall I go fetch her? She, better than I,
                  
                  Would soothe thee. Dost thou hear? He writhes as though
                  The struggling grief would choke him. Rouse thee. Julian,
                  Calm thee. Thou frighten’st me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Am I not calm?
                  There is my sword. Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  I’ll not leave thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  King!
                  Dost thou not see we’ve killed him? Thou had’st cause;
                  But I, that was his Son.—Home to thy Palace!
                  Home!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Let me stay beside thee; I’ll not speak,
                  Nor look, nor move. Let me but sit and drop
                  Tear for tear with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Cousin Julian—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Madden me not. I’m excommunicate,
                  An exile, and an outlaw, but a man.
                  Grant me the human privilege to weep
                  Alone o’er my dead father. King, I saved
                  
                  Thy life. Repay me now a thousand-fold,—
                  Go.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Aye; for a sweet comforter.
               
               Enter Paolo.
               
                  Paolo.
                  My liege,
                  The lady Annabel—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  What? is she dead?
                  Have I killed her?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Speak, Paolo. In thy charge
                  I left her.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Is she dead?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  No. Heaven forefend!
                  But she hath left the Palace.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  ’Tis the curse
                  Of blood that’s on my head; on all I love.
                  She’s lost.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Did she go forth alone?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  My liege,
                  Prince Julian’s aged Huntsman, Renzi, came,
                  
                  Sent, as he said, by thee, to bear her where
                  Her Lord was sheltered.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Hoary traitor!
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  She
                  Followed him, nothing fearing; and I too
                  Had gone, but D’Alba’s servants closed the gates,
                  And then my heart misgave me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Where’s my sword?
                  I’ll rescue her! I’ll save her!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Hast thou traced
                  Thy lady?
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  No, my liege. But much I fear—
                  Certain a closed and guarded litter took
                  The way to the western suburb.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  There, where lies
                  The palace of Count D’Alba! Stained—defiled—
                  He hath thee now, my lovely one! There’s still
                  A way—Let me but reach thee! One asylum—
                  One bridal bed—One resting place. All griefs
                  Are lost in this. Oh would I lay as thou, 
                  My Father! Leave him not in the high-way
                  For dogs to mangle. He was once a Prince.
                  Farewell!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Let me go with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  No. This deed
                  Is mine.
               
               Exit Julian.
               
                  Alfon.
                  Paolo stay by the corse. I’ll after,
                  He shall not on this desperate quest alone.
               
               
                  Paolo.
                  Rather, my liege, seek D’Alba:— I deem
                  He still is at thy Palace. Watch him well.
                  Stay by him closely. So may the sweet lady
                  Be rescued, and Prince Julian saved.
               
               
                  Alf.
                  Thou’rt right.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               Scene III
               An Apartment in an old Tower; a rich Gothic Window,
								closed, but so constructed as that the Light may be thrown in, near
								it a small arched Door, beyond which is seen an Inner Chamber, with
								an open Casement.—Annabel is borne in by D’Alba and Guards, through a strong Iron Door in the side Scene.
               
               D’Alba, Annabel, Guards.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Leave her with me. Guard well the gate; and watch
                  That none approach the tower.
                  Exeunt Guards.
                  Fair Annabel!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Who is it calls? Where am I? Who art thou?
                  Why am I here? Now heaven preserve me, D’Alba!
                  Where’s Julian? Where’s Prince Julian? Where’s my husband?
                  Renzi, who lured me from the palace, swore
                  It was to meet my husband.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Many an oath
                  First sworn in falsehood turns to truth. He’s here.
                  Calm thee, sweet lady.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Where? I see him not.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Another husband.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Then he’s dead!
                  He’s dead!
                  
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He lives.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Heard I aright? Again!
                  There is a deafening murmur in mine ears,
                  Like the moaning sound that dwells in the
							sea shell,
                  So that I hear nought plainly. Say’t again.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He lives.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now, thanks to Heaven! Take me to him.
                  Where am I?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  In an old and lonely tower
                  At the end of my poor orchard.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Take me home.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Thou hast no home.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No home! His arms! his heart!
                  Take me to him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Sweet Annabel, be still.
                  Conquer this woman’s vain impatiency,
                  And listen. Why she trembles as I were
                  
                  Some bravo. Oh that man’s free heart should bow
                  To a fair cowardice! Listen. Thou know’st
                  The sentence of the Melfi?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Aye, the unjust
                  And wicked doom that ranked the innocent
                  With the guilty. But I murmur not. I love
                  To suffer with him.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  He is banished; outlawed,
                  Cut off from every human tie;—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Not all.
                  I am his wife.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Under the Church’s ban.
                  I tell thee, Annabel, that learned Priest,
                  The sage Anselmo, deems thou art released
                  From thy unhappy vows; and will to night—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Stop. I was wedded in the light of day
                  In the great church at Naples. Blessed day!
                  I am his wife; bound to him ever more
                  
                  In sickness, penury, disgrace. Count D’Alba,
                  Thou dost misprize the world, but thou must know
                  That woman’s heart is faithful, and clings closest
                  In misery.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  If the Church proclaim thee free—
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Sir, I will not be free; and if I were
                  I’d give myself to Julian o’er again—
                  Only to Julian! Trifle thus no longer.
                  Lead me to him. Release me.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Now, by heaven,
                  I’ll bend this glorious constancy. I’ve known thee
                  Even from a little child, and I have seen
                  That stubborn spirit broken: not by fear,
                  That thou can’st quell; nor interest; nor ambition;
                  But love! love! love! I tell thee, Annabel,
                  One whom thou lov’st, stands in my danger. Wed me
                  This very night—I will procure a priest
                  And dispensations, there shall nothing lack
                  Of nuptial form—Wed me, or look  to hear
                  Of bloody justice.
                  
               
               
                  Annab.
                  My poor father, Melfi!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  The Regent? He is dead.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  God hath been merciful.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Is there no other name? no dearer?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Ha!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Hadst thou such tender love for this proud father,
                  Who little recked of thee, or thy fair looks;—
                  Is all beside forgotten?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Speak!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Why, Julian!
                  Julian, I say!
               
               
                  Annab.
                  He is beyond thy power.
                  Thanks, thanks, great God! He’s ruined, exiled, stripped
                  Of name, and land, and titles. He’s as dead.
                  Thou hast no power to harm him. He can fall
                  No deeper. Earth hath not a lowlier state
                  
                  Than princely Julian fills.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Doth not the grave
                  Lie deeper?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  What? But thou hast not the power!
                  Hast thou? Thou canst not. Oh be pitiful!
                  Speak, I conjure thee, speak!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Didst thou not hear
                  That he was exiled, outlawed, banished far
                  From the Sicilian Isles, on pain of death.
                  If, after noon to-day, he e’er were seen
                  In Sicily? The allotted bark awaits;
                  The hour is past; and he is here.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now heaven
                  Have mercy on us! D’Alba, at thy feet,
                  Upon my bended knees—Oh pity! pity!
                  Pity and pardon! I’ll not rise. I cannot.
                  I cannot stand more than a creeping worm
                  Whilst Julian’s in thy danger. Pardon him!
                  
                  Thou wast not cruel once. I’ve seen thee turn
                  Thy step from off the path to spare an insect;
                  I’ve marked thee shudder, when my falcon struck
                  A panting bird;—though thou hast tried to sneer
                  At thy own sympathy. D’Alba, thy heart
                  Is kinder than thou knowest. Save him, D’Alba!
                  Save him!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Be mine.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Am I not his?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Be mine;
                  And he shall live to the whole age of man
                  Unharmed.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  I’m his.—Oh—Oh spare him!--Only his.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Then it is thou that dost enforce the law
                  On Julian; thou, his loving wife, that guid’st
                  The officer to seize him where he lies
                  Upon his father’s corse; thou that dost
							lead
                  Thy husband to the scaffold;—thou his wife,
                  
                  His loving wife! Thou yet may’st rescue him.
               
               
                  Annab.
                  Now, God forgive thee, man! Thou torturest me
                  Worse than a thousand racks. But thou art not
                  So devilish, D’Alba. Thou hast talked of love;—
                  Would’st see me die here at thy feet? Have mercy!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Mercy! Aye, such as thou hast shewn to me
                  Through weeks and months and years. I was born strong
                  In scorn, the wise man’s passion. I had lived
                  Aloof from the juggling world, and with a string
                  Watched the poor puppets ape their several parts;
                  Fool, knave, or madman; till thy fatal charms,
                  Beautiful mischief, made me knave and fool
                  And madman; brought revenge and love and hate
                  Into my soul. I love and hate thee, lady,
                  And doubly hate myself for loving thee.
                  But, by this teeming earth, this starry Heaven,
                  And by thyself the fairest stubbornest thing
                  The fair stars shine upon, I swear to-night
                  
                  Thou shalt be mine. If willingly, I’ll save
                  Prince Julian;—but still mine. Speak. Shall he live?
                  Canst thou not speak? Wilt thou not save him?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Did she die with the word! Dost hear me, lady?
                  I asked thee wouldst thou save thy husband?
               
               
                  Annab.
                  No. 
                  Not so! Not so!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  ’Tis well.
               
               Exit D’Alba.
               
                  Annab.
                  Stay! Stay! He’s gone.
                  Count D’Alba! Save him! Save him! D’Alba’s gone,
                  And I have sentenced him.
                  After a pause.
                  He would have chosen so,
                  Would rather have died a thousand deaths than so
                  Have lived! Oh who will succour me, shut up
                  In this lone tower! none but those horrid guards,
                  And yonder hoary traitor, know where the poor,
                  
                  Poor Annabel is hidden; no man cares
                  How she may perish—only one—and he—
                  Preserve my wits! I’ll count my beads; ’twill calm me:
                  What if I hang my rosary from the casement?
                  There is a brightness in the gorgeous jewel
                  To catch men’s eyes, and haply, some may pass
                  That are not pitiless. This window’s closed;
                  But in yon chamber—Ah, ’tis open! There
                  I’ll hang the holy gem, a guiding star,
                  A visible prayer to man and God. Oh save me
                  From sin and shame! Save him! I’ll hang it there.
               
               Exit.
               End of the Fourth Act
               
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE.
               The same as the last; the arched Door nearly closed.
               Annabel.
               
                  Annabel.
                  I cannot rest. I wander to and fro
                  Within my dreary prison, as to seek
                  For comfort and find none. Each hour hath killed
                  A hope that seemed the last. The shadows point
                  Upward. The sun is sinking. Guard me, heaven,
                  Through this dread night!
                  A gun is heard without.
                  What evil sound—All sounds
                  Are evil here! Is there some murder doing?
                  Or wantonly in sport.
               
               Enter Julian through the arched Door.
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My wife! Art thou still mine?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Thine own.
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She smiles!
                  She clings to me! Her eyes are fixed on mine
                  With the old love, the old divinest look
                  Of innocence! It is yet time. She’s pure!
                  She’s undefiled!--Speak to me, Annabel.
                  Tremble not so.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  ’Tis joy. Oh I have been
                  So wretched! And to see thee when I thought
                  We ne’er should meet again! How didst thou find me?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The rosary! the blessed rosary
                  Shone in the sun-beam, like a beacon fire,
                  A guiding star! Thrice holy was its light
                  That led me here to save—
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh blessings on thee!
                  How? Where? what way? The iron door is barred!
                  Where didst thou enter Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Through the casement
                  Of yonder chamber.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  What? that grim ascent!
                  That awful depth! Didst thou dare this for me?
                  And must I?—But I fear not. I’ll go with thee.
                  I’m safe of foot, and light. I’ll go.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Thou canst not.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Then go thyself, or he will find thee here,
                  He and his ruffian band. Let us part now.
                  Kiss me again. Fly, fly from Sicily!—
                  That fearful man—but he is all one lie—
                  Told me thy life was forfeited.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He told thee
                  A truth.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh fly! fly! fly;
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My Annabel
                  The bloodhounds that he laid upon the scent
                  Have tracked me hither. Didst thou hear a gun?
                  For once the ball passed harmless.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Art thou hurt?
                  Art sure thou art not?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Yes. But they who aimed
                  That death are on the watch. Their quarry’s lodged.
                  We can escape them—one way—only one!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  How? What way?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Ask not.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Whither?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To—my father.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Then he’s alive—Oh happiness! They told me
                  That he was dead. Why do we loiter here?
                  Let’s join him now.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Now! now! Thou know’st not
                  
                  
                  How horribly these walls do picture to me
                  The several agonies whereof my soul
                  Hath drunk to day. I have been tempted, Julian,
                  By one—a fiend! tempted till I almost thought
                  God had forsaken me. But thou art here
                  To save me, and my pulse beats high again
                  With love and hope. I am light-hearted now,
                  And could laugh like a child—only these walls
                  Do crowd around me with a visible weight,
                  A palpable pressure; giving back the forms
                  Of wildest thoughts that wandered through my brain
                  Bright chattering Madness, and sedate Despair,
                  And fear the Great Unreal!—Take me hence!
                  Take me away with thee!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Not yet, not yet.
                  Thou sweetest wretch! I cannot—Dotard! Fool!
                  I must. Not yet! not yet!—Talk to me, Annabel;
                  This is the hour when thou wast wont to make
                  Earth Heaven with lovely words; the sun-set hour,
                  That woke thy spirit into joy. Once more
                  Talk to me, Annabel.
                  
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Aye, all day long,
                  When we are free. Thy voice is choked; thy looks
                  Are not on me; thy hand doth catch and twitch
                  And grasp mine painfully,—that gentle hand!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  O God! O God! that right hand!--kiss it not!
                  Take thy lips from it!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Canst thou save me, Julian?
                  Thou always dost speak truth. Canst save thyself?
                  Shall we go hence together?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Aye, one fate—
                  One home.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Why that is bliss. We shall be poor—
                  Shall we not, Julian? I shall have a joy
                  I never looked for; I shall work for thee,
                  Shall tend thee, be thy Page, thy ’Squire, thy all,—
                  Shall I not, Julian.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Annabel, look forth
                  
                  Upon this glorious world! Look once again
                  On our fair Sicily, lit by that sun
                  Whose level beams do cast a golden shine
                  On sea, and shore, and city, on the pride
                  Of bowery groves; on Etna’s smouldering top;—
                  Oh bright and glorious world! and thou of all
                  Created things most glorious, tricked in light,
                  As the stars that live in Heaven!
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Why dost thou gaze
                  So sadly on me.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  The bright stars, how oft
                  They fall, or seem to fall! The Sun—look! look!
                  He sinks, he sets in glory. Blessed orb,
                  Like thee—like thee—Dost thou remember once
                  We sate by the sea shore when all the Heaven
                  And all the ocean seemed one glow of fire
                  Red, purple, saffron, melted into one
                  Intense and ardent flame, the doubtful line
                  Where sea and sky should meet was lost in that
                  Continuous brightness; there we sate and talked
                  Of the mysterious union that blessed orb
                  Wrought between earth and heaven, of life and death—
                  High mysteries!--and thou didst wish thyself
                  A spirit sailing in that flood of light
                  Straight to the Eternal Gates, didt pray to pass
                  Away in such a glory. Annabel!
                  
                  Look out upon the burning sky, the sea
                  One lucid ruby—’tis the very hour!
                  Thou’lt be a Seraph at the Fount of Light
                  Before—
               
               
                  Anna.
                  What must I die? And wilt thou kill me?
                  Canst thou? Thou cam’st to save—
               
               
                  Julian.
                  To save thy honour!
                  I shall die with thee.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Oh, no! no! live! live!
                  If I must die—Oh it is sweet to live,
                  To breathe, to move, to feel the throbbing blood
                  Beat in the veins,—to look on such an earth
                  On such a Heaven,—to look on thee! Young life
                  Is very dear.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Would’st live for D’Alba?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  No!
                  I had forgot. I’ll die. Quick! Quick!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  One kiss!
                  
                  Angel, dost thou forgive me?
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My sword!—
                  I cannot draw it.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  Now! I’m ready.
               
               Enter Bertone, and two Murderers.
               
                  Bert.
                  Seize him!
                  Yield thee, Prince Julian! Yield thee! Seize the lady.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Oh fatal, fond delay! Dare not come near us!
                  Stand off! I’ll guard thee, sweet. But when I fall
                  Let him not triumph.
               
               
                  Bertone.
                  Yield thee!
                  Strike him down.
               
               
               
               
                  Jul.
                  Thou canst die then, my fairest.
               
               The two murderers have now advanced close to Julian.
               
                  Bertone.
                  Now!
               
               One of the murderers strikes at Julian with his sword; Annabel rushes before him, receives the wound aimed at him, and falls at his feet.
               
                  Anna.
                  (before she is wounded).
                  For thee!
                  Then after.
                  For thee. ’Tis sweet!
                  dies.
               
               
                  Anna.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Fiend, hast thou slain her? Die! die! die!
                  
                  Come on. fights and kills him.
                  
               
               
                  Bertone.
                  Call instant help! Hasten the Count!
                  Exit the other murderer.
                  Julian & Bertone fight, and Julian kills him.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  My wife!
                  My murdered wife! Doth she not breathe? I thought—
                  My sight is dim—Oh no!she’s pale! she’s cold!
                  She’s still!--If she were living she would speak
                  To comfort me. She’s mute! she’s stiff! she’s—dead!
                  Why do I shiver at the word, that am
                  Death’s factor, peopler of unhallowed graves,
                  Slayer of all my race! not thee! not thee!
                  God, in his mercy, guided the keen sword
                  To thy white bosom.—I could not. Lie there.
                  I’ll shroud thee in my mantle.
                  covering her with it.
                  The rude earth
                  Will veil thy beauty next. One kiss!--She died
                  To save me!--One kiss, Annabel! I slew
                  
                  The slave that killed thee,—but the fiend—the
									cause—
                  Is he not coming?—I will chain in life
                  Till I’ve avenged thee; I could slay an army
                  Now, in my strong despair. But that were mercy.
                  He must wear daggers in his heart. He loved her;—
                  I’ll feed his hopes, and then—Aye—ha! ha! ha!
                  That will be a revenge to make the fiends
                  Laugh—ha! ha! ha! I’ll wrap me in this cloak
                  taking one belonging to the dead bravo.
                  And in the twilight—So!—He will not know
                  My voice—it frightens me!--I have not hidden
                  Thee quite, my Annabel! There is one tress
                  Floating in springy grace—as if—she’s dead!
                  She’s dead! I must not gaze, for then my heart
                  Will break before its time. He comes. The stairs
                  Groan at his pressure.
               
               Enter D’Alba.
               
                  D’Alba.
                  entering to an Attendant
                  Back, and watch the gate!--
                  All’s tranquil. Where’s the traitor?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Dead.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Who slew him?
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And the lady,—where is she?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  At rest.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Fair Gentleness! After this perilous storm
                  She needs must lack repose.I’ll wait her here.
                  Friend! thou hast done good service to the state
                  And me; we’re not ungrateful. Julian’s sword
                  Fails him not often; and the slave who fled
                  Proclaimed him Victor.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He slew two.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  And thou
                  Slew’st him? Aye there he lies in the ermined cloak
                  Of royalty, his haughty shroud! Six ells
                  Of rude uncostly linen serves to wrap
                  Your common corse; but this man was born swathed
                  In regal purple; lived so; and so died.
                  So be he buried. Let not mine enemy
                  Call me ungenerous. Roll him in his ermine
                  And dig a hole without the city gate
                  For him and the proud Regent. Quick! I’d have
                  
                  The funeral speedy. Ah! the slaughtering sword
                  Lies by him, brown with clotted gore. Hence! hence!
                  And drag the carrion with thee.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Wilt thou not
                  Look on the corse?
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  I cannot wait her waking.
                  I must go feast my eyes on her fair looks—
                  Divinest Annabel! My widowed bride!--
                  Where is she?
               
               
                  Julian.
                  uncovering the body
                  There. Now gaze thyself to Hell!
                  Gloat with hot love upon that beauteous dust!—
                  She’s safe! She’s dead!
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  But touch her not
                  She’s mine.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  Oh perfectest and loveliest thing!
                  Eternal curses rest upon his head
                  
                  Who murdered thee!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Off! off! Pollute her not!
                  She’s white! She’s pure!--Curses! Now curse for curse
                  On the foul murderer! On him who turned
                  The sweet soul from her home, who slew her father,
                  Hunted her husband as a beast of prey,
                  Pursued, imprisoned, lusted, left no gate
                  Open save that to Heaven!—Off! gaze not on her!
                  Thy look is profanation!
                  
                  Enter Alfonso, Leanti, Valore, &c.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Entering.
                  Here, Leanti!
                  This way! Oh sight of horror! Julian! Julian!
               
               
                  Valore.
                  The Princess dead! Why D’Alba—
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Seize him guards.
                  Lead him before the States. This bloody scene
                  Calls for deep vengeance.
               
               
                  D’Alba.
                  If I were not weary
                  Of a world that sweats under a load of fools—
                  
                  Old creaking vanes that turn as the wind changes—
                  Lords, I’d defy ye! I’d live on for ever!
                  And I defy ye now. For she is gone—
                  The glorious vision!--and the Patriarch’s years
                  Were valueless. Do with me as ye will;—
                  Ye cannot call back her.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Off with him!
                  Exit D’Alba guarded.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Julian! Wilt thou not speak?
                  
               
               
                  Julian.
                  I have been thanking heaven
                  That she is dead.
               
               
                  Valore.
                  His wits are gone.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Julian
                  Look on me. Dost thou know me? I’m thy Cousin,
                  Thy comforter.
               
               
                  Julian.
                  She was my Comforter!
                  
                  And now—But I do know thee; thou’rt the King;
                  The pretty boy I loved—She loved thee too!
                  I’m glad thou’rt come to close my eyes. Draw nearer
                  That I may see thy face. Where art thou?
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  Here!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  Poor child he weeps! Send for the honoured dead
                  Beside the city gate,—he pardoned me!
                  Bury us in one grave,—all in one grave!
                  I did not kill herStrew her with white flowers,
                  For she was innocent.
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  Cheer thee! Take hope!
               
               
                  Valore.
                  Raise up his head.
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  My Julian!
               
               
                  Julian.
                  He forgave me,—
                  Thou know’st he did.—White flowers! Nothing but white!
                  Dies.
                  
               
               
                  Leanti.
                  He’s gone!
               
               
                  Alfon.
                  And I am left in the wide world
                  Alone. My Julian!
               
               THE END.
