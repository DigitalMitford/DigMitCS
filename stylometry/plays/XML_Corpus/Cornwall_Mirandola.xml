		<stage>SCENE---At and near Mirandola, in Italy.</stage>
		<div type="act"><head>ACT I.</head>
			<div type="scene"><head>SCENE I.</head>
				<stage>The outer yard of an inn on the road to Mirandola.</stage>
				<stage>
					<strong>Beatrice</strong> enters from the Inn. </stage>
				<sp><speaker>Bea.</speaker>
					<line>I thought I heard the trampling of horses.Marco!---There are so few
						travellers who pass this road,that really we must make the most of all who
						come.Hark! that was certainly a horse's step.---Marco!---There, again:
						somebody is certainly coming.</line></sp><stage>She listens.</stage>
				<stage>
					<strong>Marco</strong> enters. </stage>
				<sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>By Saint Peter, this will be a rare day togo to sleep in. There'll be
						nothing awake to-day butthe sun, and my wife. Why, Beatrice, what's the
						matter?Are you bent double before your time? Shelooks like Fine-ear, in the
						Fairy tale, who listens to hearthe grass grow.
						Beatrice!</line></sp><sp><speaker>Beatrice.</speaker>
					<line>Hark! don't you hear?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>Hear? no: and yet---Ha! I do hear somethingnow. Some travellers, I
						suppose: yes, they are now almost close to us. They stop. Ah! there they
						areat the end of the orchard.---Go in, go in and preparebreakfast for them.
						There never yet was a travellerwho had'nt a good appetite.</line></sp>
				<stage>
					<strong>Beatrice</strong> goes in.</stage>
				<line>A good clever girl that, tho' she talks more than she need at times; but,
					what!---there's no one perfect. Now if these gallants should be coming to the
					merry-making at Court, which was held yesterday, in honor of the Duke's marriage
					that happened some time ago, why they'll be a day too late, that's all.---So,
					who is this?</line>
				<stage>
					<strong>Andrea</strong> enters. </stage>
				<sp><speaker>Andrea.</speaker>
					<line> Are you the landlord of this
						house?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>I am.</line></sp><sp><speaker>Andrea.</speaker>
					<line>The Duke's son, Lord Guido, is here on hisway home from Naples. Get some
						refreshment ready,and be quick.</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>The Duke's son?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Andrea.</speaker>
					<line>Yes.---Why what's the matter? The Duke'sson, I
						said.</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>What he who died?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Andrea.</speaker>
					<line>Died!---Nonsense! how could he be here ifhe died? he was only
						wounded.</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>Not dead? that's odd. Is he coming to theCourt
						feast?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Andrea.</speaker>
					<line>We've heard of no feast. What is it for?Is any body married, or
						dead?</line></sp><sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>Hush! your master's here.---Beatrice!</line>
				</sp><stage>
					<strong>Guido, Casti</strong> , and <strong>Julio</strong> enter. </stage>
				<sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Ah! Signior Casti, you were gallant ever, </line>
					<line>At home and in the field.---Here, fellow; shew </line>
					<line>Our servants where the horses may be housed.</line>
				</sp><stage>
					<strong>Beatrice</strong> enters. </stage>
				<sp><speaker>Marco.</speaker>
					<line>I will, my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Take care of mine,---a grey.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>This is the prettiest girl that I have seen </line>
					<line>Since I left Naples.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Bea.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>You have forgot poor Bayard.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No, indeed. Good fellow, </line>
					<line>Go with this man, and he will show you where </line>
					<line>A berry-brown horse is panting, wet and white </line>
					<line>With foam.---Carlo's gone onwards?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Serv.</speaker>
					<line>Yes, my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>That horse---he is a friend of mine, (the best </line>
					<line>That ever bore a man thro' blood and death;) </line>
					<line>Take excellent care of him as you expect </line>
					<line>Requital. </line>
					<stage>
						<strong>Marco</strong> and <strong>Servant</strong> exeunt. </stage>
					<line>Thanks, good Casti, many thanks: </line>
					<line>Old Bayard too should thank you if he could.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Now, hostess, we are hungry travellers: go </line>
					<line>And strip your larder of it's best: we come </line>
					<line>With desperate thoughts against it.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Pretty hostess! </line>
					<line>Are<em>you</em>the hostess of this pleasant place?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Beat.</speaker>
					<line>Yes, my lord, yes.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>You make her blush.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>No more.---Good hostess, hie thou in and quickly make </line>
					<line>The best of preparation: we shall be </line>
					<line>With thee anon.</line>
					<stage>
						<strong>Beatrice</strong> exit. </stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>We shall come to thee soon.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Why, my dear lord, this peasant seems to take </line>
					<line>Your fancy.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I like a pretty face </line>
					<line>At court or in a cottage.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>And in camp?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No; there one's thoughts are taught to swerve </line>
					<line>From their more natural bent.---I hate the camp. </line>
					<line>I hate it's noise and stiff parade,---it's blank </line>
					<line>And empty forms, and stately courtesy. </line>
					<line>Where between bows and blows, a smile and a stab, </line>
					<line>There's scarce a moment. Soldiers always live </line>
					<line>In idleness or peril: both are bad.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>I fear that you are right, indeed.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>How! right?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I am.--- </line>
					<line>Give me an intellectual nobler life; </line>
					<line>Not fighting like the herded elephants, which, </line>
					<line>Beckon'd by some fierce slave, go forth to war, </line>
					<line>And trample in the dust their fellow brute. </line>
					<line>But let<em>me</em>live amongst high thoughts and smiles</line>
					<line>As beautiful as love; with grasping hands, </line>
					<line>And a heart that flutters with diviner life </line>
					<line>Whene'er my step is heard.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Why, what is this?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>A picture of a happier lot, dear friend, </line>
					<line>Than you and I have known.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Had I not seen </line>
					<line>You both fight bravely,---better than myself, </line>
					<line>I should have doubted you.---What! rail at war--- </line>
					<line>Bright eyed Bellona?---Oh! for shame, for shame! </line>
					<line>I must forswear your company, my Lord. </line>
					<line>For me, I like all folks who follow war, </line>
					<line>Down to the very suttler: I am even </line>
					<line>Friend to the commissary.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, when you run </line>
					<line>In debt.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>With empty pockets.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Or---or when </line>
					<line>He feasts his friends.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Or falls in love, and wishes </line>
					<line>To give a trifle to some girl.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed, he<em>is</em>too much addicted---while I speak,</line>
					<line>I grieve to talk thus of him---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Moral Lord! </line>
					<line>Oh! this is well. Go on; and, Signior, you </line>
					<line>Who smile but once a week, (then not for joy,)--- </line>
					<line>You smile now; yet, you must remember ('tis</line>
					<line>Scarce two years since,) at Baiae, a pale girl, </line>
					<line>Who lived so much in private?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Spare her: nay, </line>
					<line>She was unfortunate.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>And you?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Was kind. </line>
					<line>I know the story: touch not on it now. </line>
					<line>It is a melancholy tale, fit only </line>
					<line>For the fire-side and winter: some dull day, </line>
					<line>When the clouds leave a shadow on your brow, </line>
					<line>I'll tell it to you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Be content; I was </line>
					<line>Her friend,---a father, but no more; believe 't.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Must I? Well, be it:&#134;---but this hostess stays </line>
					<line>A long time 'ere she summons us, methinks. </line>
					<line>If I eat double 'tis no fault of mine. </line>
					<line>I may as well go in,---and---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>But be civil.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Civil? I'll be as loving.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, and brief </line>
					<line>In your discourse.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I shall keep watch o'er you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>And th'hostess?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay; over both wolf and lamb.</line>
					<stage>
						<strong>Julio</strong> exit into the inn. </stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>I never saw you in so gay a mood: </line>
					<line>Have you heard news?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No;---no.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>I fear I've marred </line>
					<line>Your gaiety.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ah! no: 'twas but a trick </line>
					<line>To cheat away sad folly.---I have heard </line>
					<line>Nothing: my courier never, as you know, </line>
					<line>Returned: my letters are unanswer'd:---From </line>
					<line>My father (yet he was kind once) I might have borne </line>
					<line>This fearful silence; but from her---Oh! her </line>
					<line>Whom like a star I worshipped.---Pshaw! my eyes </line>
					<line>Are like a girl's to-day. I've no doubt </line>
					<line>But all is well.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>I hope so.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay;<em>I</em>hope.</line>
					<line>Why should I fear?---you do not fear? you know </line>
					<line>Nothing, good Casti, of my love?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Nothing: be calm.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I know not how it is; </line>
					<line>But a foreboding presses on my heart </line>
					<line>At times, until I sicken.</line>
					<line>---I have heard,</line>
					<line>And from men learned, that before the touch </line>
					<line>(The common, coarser touch) of good or ill,--- </line>
					<line>That oftentimes a subtler sense informs </line>
					<line>Some spirits of the approach of 'things to be.' </line>
					<line>Fate comes before it's time; like Hope or Fear </line>
					<line>Reverting on the soul, with surer aim.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>What more!&#134;</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I've a deep dull sense of pain to come </line>
					<line>Clinging upon my heart.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>So lovers talk; </line>
					<line>And feel, perhaps.</line>
					<line>Suspense to them is as</line>
					<line>A hideous ghost, changing it's shape for ever. </line>
					<line>Thus in wild evenings children's fears, you know, </line>
					<line>Shape devils out of shadows.&#134;---Oh! be gay. </line>
					<line>Morning will soon be here, and she you sigh for </line>
					<line>Will smile these dreams away.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>May it be so! </line>
					<line>Let's talk no more of this at present.---Where </line>
					<line>Is Julio?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Likeliest by the cottage fire, </line>
					<line>Helping the pretty hostess.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Let us go. </line>
					<line>You think, then, she---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I think </line>
					<line>Not of her; save that she is fair and true. </line>
					<line>Stifle these fears: why, in some three hours hence </line>
					<line>You'll see her</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>So I shall, indeed.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>Let's drink </line>
					<line>Her health in purest water.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No: in wine.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>In wine then, be it. High Falernian?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Curio.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, </line>
					<line>In nectar. Why, methinks, these dreams of mine </line>
					<line>Are almost banished.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>With yourself remains </line>
					<line>The power to do't. Be lord of your own mind. </line>
					<line>The dread of evil is the worst of ill; </line>
					<line>A tyrant, yet a rebel, dragging down</line>
					<line>The clear-eyed judgment from its spiritual throne, </line>
					<line>And leagued with all the base and blacker thoughts </line>
					<line>To overwhelm the soul.&#134; But come, our friend </line>
					<line>Waits, and---the pretty hostess.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>There: my hand </line>
					<line>Is firm as 'tis in battle.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>So it is. </line>
					<line>Now then: nay, go you first. I'll follow.</line></sp>

			</div><div type="scene"><head>SCENE II.</head>
				<stage>A Garden of the Duke's Palace.</stage>
				<stage>Isidora, Isabella, Hypolito.</stage>
				<sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Cheer thee, dear sister: nay---these mournful looks </line>
					<line>Shame all our smiles.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>Dear aunt!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Were I the Duke, </line>
					<line>I should be jealous of your grief.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Madam!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed.---A jealous thing is happiness,--- </line>
					<line>And delicate too, for round it all must be </line>
					<line>Warm like itself and pleasant, else it flies; </line>
					<line>Like summer birds from winter.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Yesterday,--- </line>
					<line>It's ceremony and toil have worn me down. </line>
					<line>Forgive me for it: I am scarcely used </line>
					<line>As yet to your court splendors.---I shall be </line>
					<line>A Duchess shortly, such as you could wish. </line>
					<line>I was not born, you know, to princely pomp, </line>
					<line>And it sits ill on me. Hypolito! </line>
					<line>Why are<em>you</em>sad, dear boy? I thought I was</line>
					<line>The only mocker here.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>'Wake, dreaming child! </line>
					<line>Your aunt, the Duchess, speaks to you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>Dear Lady.</line>
				</sp><stage>Takes <strong>Isidora's</strong> hand.</stage>
				<sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>A pretty gallant: so,---in time he'll break </line>
					<line>A promise smoothly.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I hope not; yet there are </line>
					<line>None of his faithless sex who cannot feign.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Except my brother?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Ay: except the Duke. </line>
					<line>But come, Hypolito; I never hear </line>
					<line>Now how your falcon flies, nor of the barb </line>
					<line>Your uncle gave you.---How is this? it was </line>
					<line>A true Arabian, was it not?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed </line>
					<line>I scarcely know. I have not rid of late.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>He keeps his chamber, like a languid girl, </line>
					<line>And reads romance.---"Indeed, I scarcely know---" </line>
					<line>Why that was lisped forth like a girl.---For shame! </line>
					<line>What do you know then, sirrah?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I know </line>
					<line>By heart, by heart, those gentle stories which </line>
					<line>My Aunt (before she<em>was</em>my Aunt) gave to me,</line>
					<line>And told me with a smile, such as I never </line>
					<line>Saw on her face again,---'These lines were strung </line>
					<line>'By frenzied Tasso whom a princess scorned, </line>
					<line>'And these flew forth from Ariosto's quill, </line>
					<line>'And these sad Petrarch, who lamented long </line>
					<line>'Laura his love, once writ; and some there were </line>
					<line>'Inscribed by great Boccaccio's golden pen, </line>
					<line>'Mirthful and mournful, fit for every heart.'</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>A pretty list: and is this all you read? </line>
					<line>Oh! I must look to you.---The father comes; </line>
					<line>In haste, it seems. </line>
				</sp><stage>
					<strong>Gheraldi</strong> enters. </stage>
				<line>Well, father?</line>
				<sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>The fair blessing of the day </line>
					<line>Rest on you all.---Madam, my duty bends </line>
					<line>Before you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I am thankful, father, for </line>
					<line>Your blessing.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Thanks, Gheraldi; but you came </line>
					<line>In haste, Sir: how was this? Have any news </line>
					<line>Reached our so quiet place?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>I do not like the book you gave me, father.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Silence!---You do not answer, father. How!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Come here, Hypolito, come.</line>
					<stage>
						<strong>Isidora</strong> and <strong>Hypolito</strong> talk apart. </stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>In your look </line>
					<line>I read a---something that I would not read. </line>
					<line>The Duchess hears us not; you need not drop </line>
					<line>Your eyes thus cautiously. Speak freely to me; </line>
					<line>What is't?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Be patient, Madam: you will need </line>
					<line>Great store of patience. Guido---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Ha; speak lower.---Hypolito!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Hyp.</speaker>
					<line>Talk kindly to me.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Well; </line>
					<line>Kiss me, and now begone: the father has </line>
					<line>Some words for me. Perhaps, dear sister, you---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I was about to leave you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Do not think </line>
					<line>I wish that: but some business, such as you </line>
					<line>Would think but tedious, calls me hence.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Farewell!</line>
					<stage>
						<strong>Isidora</strong> and <strong>Hypolito</strong> exeunt. </stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Father, if I can read your mind, (and now </line>
					<line>I ought to read it,) you have news will call </line>
					<line>My spirit into action:---Is it so? </line>
					<line>Well! I can act. How I can think, you know. </line>
					<line>How I will give my cunning force, and weave </line>
					<line>The subtle threads of many a project 'round </line>
					<line>My victim's brain, thou---thou shalt see.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I have </line>
					<line>Not told my news.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>I see it 'ere you speak. </line>
					<line>It is of Guido: he has then discovered?---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Not so.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Then all is well.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Why, still not so. </line>
					<line>He has not yet discovered---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Father, speak. </line>
					<line>Am I to guess and guess and still mistake, </line>
					<line>While you, with all the tidings on your tongue, </line>
					<line>Keep all from me! What you know, boldly speak.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Lord Guido, then, is well: that is some news; </line>
					<line>For when we last heard of him, he lay sick </line>
					<line>Upon his bed at Naples.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Yes,---go on.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>He knows not of his father's marriage yet: </line>
					<line>But being impatient at the silence which </line>
					<line>His Isidora, and his father kept, </line>
					<line>He left the South (forgetting smaller ills) </line>
					<line>And comes straight to Mirandola!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed! </line>
					<line>He must be stopped.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>He should have been, had I </line>
					<line>Known of his coming; but he is here already.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>What! not arrived?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>In two hours hence he'll stand </line>
					<line>Before his father.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Has the Duke yet learned </line>
					<line>His coming.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>No: I've kept the secret; but </line>
					<line>It must be known, and quickly.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>And those letters--- </line>
					<line>Those letters of the Duke; they never reached </line>
					<line>Guido at Naples---of this you are sure!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Never; nor those he wrote unto the Duke, </line>
					<line>Except that one first telling that he lived; </line>
					<line>(Dead Gaspero was an honest knave to us---) </line>
					<line>I hold them safe: for in them lies my life.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Why then go bravely to the Duke; </line>
					<line>And tell him Guido comes: tell him, at once, </line>
					<line>That all the bright tears Isidora shed, </line>
					<line>Dropped for his son.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Ha! but<em>I</em>cautioned her</line>
					<line>(Because the Duke was jealous) when she heard </line>

					<line>The name of Guido.---How shall this be answered?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Who can betray? Why did she marry him?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Nay,---'twas her mother's want---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Well, well: now go </line>
					<line>Unto the Duke (I know his humour well) </line>
					<line>And tell this. Of his marriage you can say---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>What?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>You can hint that haply Guido may </line>
					<line>Clothe him in ignorance,---perhaps pretend </line>
					<line>He wrote to say he lived, and so forth: ha? </line>
					<line>Tell him of Guido's friendship for those men--- </line>
					<line>Those men who did rebel: and you can shew </line>
					<line>How good a casuist you are, father, when </line>
					<line>A doubt springs up; and you can pour a balm </line>
					<line>(You have both sting and honey, like the bee,) </line>
					<line>If there be need, and---pshaw! I school my master.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>You flatter, gracious lady: you are still </line>
					<line>A keen displomatist: you surely cannot </line>
					<line>Need my poor service.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>What is this?---Gheraldi! </line>
					<line>What is it you ask?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Nothing: no, tho' you said---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>I say so still: my interest at Rome </line>
					<line>Is great as ever. You shall have, be sure, </line>
					<line>The Cardinal's hat, when old Galotti dies.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Have I your word for this?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>
					<line>Sir, be content; </line>
					<line>I give my honourable word.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Enough.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isab.</speaker>

					<line>Dear lady, fare you well.---Now for the Duke. </line>
					<line>He is as shifting as the April wind: </line>
					<line>And how to break this news I know not. Guido </line>
					<line>By this has got my letter, and knows that </line>
					<line>His love is here; no more. And now---and now, </line>

					<line>Do I not see those earthly gods mine own, </line>
					<line>Power, wealth, high reputation, (holy cheat!) </line>
					<line>Like dazzling sun-beams on my stricken eye </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! not so.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>In faith it has.---Dear girl, I know you hate </line>
					<line>These empty pageantries. Jove! so do I. </line>
					<line>I'd rather be in battle, and weighed down </line>
					<line>By steel and iron than by these idle gauds. </line>
					<line>But we must play our part, my sweet one, in </line>
					<line>This silly world. Could I order things here, </line>
					<line>Half of the moon I'd waste in war: the rest </line>
					<line>I'd give to Cupid.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>So: not all to love then?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Why, no---yet I am wrong; for Oh! with you </line>
					<line>Who could desert the chamber for the camp? </line>
					<line>Not I. I would be with you ever---ever.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>That were too long.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Too long, my Isidora?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Ay: 'Ever' is a long time, my dear lord: </line>
					<line>Love has no such eternity.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed, 'tis so. Life even has its end; </line>
					<line>And love cannot be longer sure than life.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>It is: or else 'tis nothing.---Did I think </line>
					<line>That in the narrow limit of this world </line>
					<line>Sweet love were bound---</line>
					<line>Did</line>
					<em>I</em> fear that beyond <line>These earthy barriers (which our winged
						thoughts </line>
					<line>Still strive to over-fly, and still in vain,) </line>
					<line>Love were no resident,&#134; I would---but you--- </line>
					<line>You are a traitor to the rose crown'd God. </line>
					<line>I'll kiss you in revenge.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>You should not punish </line>
					<line>One who is ignorant only.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Punish! How! </line>
					<line>Will that be punishment? I said that I </line>
					<line>Would kiss you, love.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I know it---in revenge.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>True; in revenge. Revenge is bitter sweet: </line>
					<line>And in its rich completion lies as well </line>
					<line>Gall as oblivious balm: a paradox </line>
					<line>Of passion is revenge. 'Tween you and me, </line>
					<line>Fair Isidora, let it never live.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I hope not, Sir.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>It shall not. Mark! I speak </line>
					<line>More boldly here than you. I know my heart: </line>
					<line>And your's too can I read.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>What! read my heart?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>I spoke in jest: you tremble: I am calm </line>
					<line>(You see't) as conscious love---or fate---or death.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I'm often thus: pray take no heed of it. </line>

					<stage>Puts out his hand.</stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I did not note your hand, but thro' your voice </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Of what?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>That you were angry: nothing more.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! then you far mistake me. I am not </line>
					<line>A leaf blown to and fro' by every breath: </line>
					<line>I am as stedfast as the oak;---ay, more, </line>
					<line>As little to be shook or turned aside</line>
					<line>From my vowed purpose as the based rock, </line>
					<line>Which when the blasts of thundering winter tear </line>
					<line>The pines away from their strong rifted holds, </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I am glad you are so calm.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Why are you glad---why glad </line>
					<line>My Isidora? You can ne'er have cause </line>
					<line>To dread my anger?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I hope not.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You </line>
					<line>Could never dread me, Isidora?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Never. </line>
					<line>For never could I do you wrong, my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>My own sweet love! Oh! my dear peerless wife! </line>
					<line>By the blue sky and all its crowding stars </line>
					<line>I love you better---Oh! far better than </line>
					<line>Woman was ever loved. There's not an hour </line>
					<line>Of day or dreaming night but I am with thee: </line>
					<line>There's not a wind but whispers of thy name, </line>
					<line>And not a flower that sleeps beneath the moon </line>
					<line>But in its hues or fragrance tells a tale </line>
					<line>Of thee, my love, to thy Mirandola. </line>
					<line>Speak, dearest Isidora, can you love </line>
					<line>As I do? Can---but no, no; I shall grow </line>
					<line>Foolish if thus I talk. You must be gone </line>
					<line>You must be gone, fair Isidora, else </line>
					<line>The business of the Dukedom soon will cease. </line>
					<line>I speak the truth, by Dian. Even now </line>
					<line>Gheraldi waits without (or should) to see me </line>
					<line>In faith, you must go: one kiss, and so, away.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>

				<line>Welcome, father, welcome: </line>

					<line>Father, I hate these mournful moods: I hate 'em. </line>
					<line>Be joyful, Sir, or look so.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My dear lord, </line>
					<line>I have some news, which while this spirit lasts, </line>
					<line>I almost fear to tell. 'Twill strike cold on </line>
					<line>Your mind, my lord; but---but it must be told. </line>
					<line>Your son, my lord,---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>How! well; go on.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Lord Guido will be here, my lord, within </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Again, Sir,---speak again.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Your son, </line>
					<line>Lord Guido will be here within this hour.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>I'm glad to hear it. </line>
					<line>He uses little ceremony: well! </line>
					<line>How learned you this?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>His courier has arrived, </line>
					<line>Who left him scarce two hours ago: he then </line>
					<line>Was coming hither strait.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Has he not written?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>He has not; but---(and this indeed seems strange,) </line>
					<line>His servant says---tho' this must be surmise--- </line>
					<line>That his young master still is ignorant of </line>
					<line>Your highness' marriage.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>That's impossible! </line>
					<line>I wrote to him twice---more.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Yes, Sir; but---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>But what? </line>
					<line>Speak!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Did your highness ever hear the name </line>
					<line>O'the friend the Duchess mourned so?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Never: she </line>
					<line>Wished not to tell it; so, altho' my mind </line>
					<line>Dislikes such secrets, I have never asked.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Lord Guido then never confided his--- </line>
					<line>Attachment to you?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>His---his? Never.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Never?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Never. I feel a faintness o'er me. Never. </line>
					<line>Did he---did he---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Another time, my lord, </line>
					<line>Let's speak of this. As to your son's return---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Monk! I must have your answer.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Well: I have heard </line>
					<line>My lord, that he---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>I listen: go on.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>That he </line>
					<line>Once loved the Duchess.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>How! great Heaven! am I </line>
					<line>Awake?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I would not have disclosed this tale </line>
					<line>To your Highness, but---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Be silent. Can it be </line>
					<line>That he (I know not what I say) has been </line>
					<line>Deceived?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Your Highness wrote to him before </line>
					<line>Your marriage?---No.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>No; not befor't: we thought </line>
					<line>That he was dead; yet when the news (glad news </line>
					<line>I thought it,) came that still he lived, I sent </line>
					<line>Direct to Naples.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher</speaker>
					<line>True; by Gaspero.</line>
				</sp>
				<sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>But wherefore,---nay, how was't you dared conceal </line>
					<line>From me that he had loved her? Speak to that</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I thought it a boyish fancy, soon to change. </line>
					<line>Yet that he loved her once, (madly) I can </line>
					<line>Avouch.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>He is not apt to change.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Why that--- </line>
					<line>When first I knew he had not written home, </line>
					<line>Struck on my mind. I own it.</line>
				</sp>
				<sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker><stage>aside.</stage> <line>---Upon mine </line>
					<line>It falls as cold as winter. You should not </line>
					<line>Have kept it from me. 'Twas a fault.</line></sp>
				<sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Nay, Sir,---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>O Heaven! had I but known for whom those tears </line>
					<line>Were shed:---but<em>still</em>she weeps: Ah! wherefore still?</line>
					<line>He is alive.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Perhaps he comes </line>
					<line>Here to reproach or make a shew of grief: </line>
					<line>Perhaps---Did you not speak?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Yes, Sir; your son---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Did I not watch him thro' his headstrong youth, </line>
					<line>This fault forgiving and forgetting that--- </line>
					<line>His friendship with that false Vitelli, whom </line>
					<line>I hate as I hate shame---his strange request </line>
					<line>For those three rebels (that was never cleared) </line>
					<line>Marni, Saletto, Rossi? you know this.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>If I might but advise---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Be dumb, Sir. I </line>
					<line>Can be my own good counsel. Did I not </line>
					<line>Write, and so kindly too?</line>
					<line>Did---did he come</line>
					<line>Quite straight from Naples?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Yes, my lord; I hear </line>
					<line>He only staid at Count Vitelli's house; </line>
					<line>And there not long.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>At Count Vitelli's? He </line>
					<line>Can never pass that traitor's den. What spell </line>
					<line>Doth drag him there?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>None that I know of, Sir, </line>
					<line>But,&#134; may I now advise? If aught be wrong </line>
					<line>Touching Vitelli's friendship with your son. </line>
					<line>(Tho' I hope nothing<em>is</em>wrong) or---or if</line>
					<line>He loves the lady Isidora still,---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Death! thou false monk!---Sir, if your tongue but utter </line>
					<line>A word of that---What! love her? love!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I meant---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You said he loved.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Did I? pray pardon me. </line>
					<line>This news has ruffled me, my lord. I beg </line>
					<line>That you'll forget. My mouth is filled to-day </line>
					<line>With errors.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Yet should he<em>indeed</em>love her?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>If then, my lord, your son should but pretend </line>
					<line>To love, and urge you to injustice---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Ha! </line>
					<line>That's well---well thought of. Oh! there's many a knave </line>
					<line>About me (that I feel) too ready still </line>
					<line>To second old Vitelli's bloody hand. </line>
				</sp><em>Can</em> he be foe to me? I will not think it. <line>Yet I'll be calm, and

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Why all is well then;---yet, </line>
					<line>(What do you mean?) you seem to mock my joy, </line>
					<line>And lay a leaden hand upon the wings </line>
					<line>Of all my hopes.---Oh! Isidora, where, </line>
					<line>Where are<em>you</em>loitering now when Guido's here?</line>
					<line>By the bright god of love, I'll punish you, </line>
					<line>Idler, and press your rich red lips until </line>
					<line>The colour flies.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord: nay, do not frown. </line>
					<line>I have a story of deep interest, Sir. </line>
					<line>It is my duty (my sad duty now,) </line>
					<line>To break unto your ear some tidings.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Quick!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Your father, my dear lord, is married.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>So.---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Reasons of state---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Keep 'em, good Monk, I have no stomach now </line>
					<line>For any food but love.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Strong reasons did induce my lord ('twas when </line>
					<line>You were reported dead) to seek a bride. </line>
					<line>He left the common course that monarchs use, </line>
					<line>And chose from out the land he govern'd, one </line>
					<line>Who might have shamed the world.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>That was not well, </line>
					<line>At least.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I mean she was so fair, my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I mark you. Well?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord your father (urged </line>
					<line>By some state policy, and fearful lest </line>
					<line>Your death should snap the link your friendship formed </line>
					<line>'Tween him, and Count Navarro,)---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Chose his daughter?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>No; not---not thus.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>How then? Speak! Is my heart </line>
					<line>Bursting? What is't I fear? My very soul </line>
					<line>Is sick, and full of some dismay, as tho' </line>
					<line>Fate were upon me. If---I dare not ask: </line>
					<line>I dare not, tho' a word would end it all. </line>
					<line>Gheraldi! no, no, no: silence awhile: </line>
					<line>I will not hear thee now. Oh! heaven and earth! </line>
					<line>If it were so---it cannot be: it shall not. </line>
					<line>Yet if it were---Oh! Isidora, you, </line>
					<line>What<em>you</em>---She is as constant as the stars</line>
					<line>That never vary, and more chaste than they. </line>
					<line>Forgive, forgive me that I slander thee </line>
					<line>Even in dreams. Gheraldi, now I'll listen, </line>
					<line>And you shall tell your tale. I was a fool </line>
					<line>Just now. Forgive me, father:---now.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I said your father did desire a bride </line>
					<line>From out his realm. Navarro's daughter then </line>
					<line>Was woo'd; now she is married: but he had </line>
					<line>Two nieces.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, I see't. My father saw </line>
					<line>The lady Julia: yes, I see how 'twas; </line>
					<line>It was so, was it not?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>He saw her there.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, ay: she was a pretty girl when last </line>
					<line>I was at home: and so he married her?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>He saw them both, Sir, with a favouring eye. </line>
					<line>The lady Isidora then in tears---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>True; they might not become her: yet she's fair. </line>
					<line>When joy is in her eye 'tis like the light </line>
					<line>Of Heaven: blue, deep and ethereal blue. </line>
					<line>I would not wish a life more beautiful; </line>
					<line>And, were she but a Saint, I'd worship her. </line>
					<line>Sad Isidora! Did thine eyes indeed </line>
					<line>Shower diamond drops for me? My gentle love! </line>
					<line>But Guido (thine) is come at last to kiss</line>
					<line>The tears away for ever. Happiness </line>
					<line>Looks out to find thee; shall it look in vain!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>May I proceed, my lord?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I had forgot. </line>
					<line>Where were we?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>I was telling that&#134; your father </line>
					<line>Saw Count Navarro's nieces, and preferr'd </line>
					<line>The elder.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>You---you said he<em>married Julia</em>.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>No, my lord: no.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Whom then? it cannot be.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord! I---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Monk! speak out: Curse on my trembling. </line>
					<line>One word---a single word. Now:---tho' your breath </line>
					<line>Carry damnation (as I think it does) </line>
					<line>To every hope of mine, be quick, quick.---Now. </line>
					<line>Stun me with sorrow, lest I feel too much, </line>
					<line>And slay thee. What's her name---my father's bride?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>'Tis Isidora.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Thou has done't.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord! </line>
					<line>Look up, my Lord! So---there: you're very pale. </line>
					<line>Nay, for your father's sake.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ha! ha! ha! ha!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>Lord Guido! I---Gheraldi---speak to you. </line>
					<line>Oh! well: I see you know me now. Not so. </line>
					<line>Nay, look more cheerfully.---You're better now?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Thou---thou knew'st all my love. Thou busy priest---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Thou pander to my father's wish, </line>
					<line>(He is no father, I disown him.) Thou--- </line>
					<line>Thou busy meddling Monk.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>My lord, my lord, </line>
					<line>This is not well!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Away! my mother? Oh!<em>my</em>mother was</line>
					<line>As pure as purity. I will not talk </line>
					<line>Of her who<em>is</em>---yet oh! what pity 'tis</line>
					<line>That one so fair should now be full of blots, </line>
					<line>And that a face which love had breathed upon </line>
					<line>Should now be scarred all over. Once, I thought </line>
					<line>That in her eyes, (how beautiful they were!) </line>
					<line>Her soul shone out.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>If you will let me speak---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>But she is grown a harlot in my sight. </line>
					<line>What! married to my father, to<em>my</em>father!</line>
					<line>What! smile upon the son, and wed the sire, </line>
					<line>Because---there's some strange cause. What blinding spell </line>
					<line>Is there now hung between us and the Moon, </line>
					<line>That dims the sights of women? There's a cause: </line>
					<line>I dare not guess: I will not.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>May I speak?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Father Gheraldi, you have done your errand. </line>
					<line>Tell the Duke of Mirandola, his Son </line>
					<line>Is now at ease.---Say that the news at first </line>
					<line>Was somewhat stirring: but that he---ay, he </line>
					<line>Forgives---forgets; no, never, never can </line>
					<line>That soon forgot that all his life was blighted. </line>
					<line>Say what you will, Sir.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Gher.</speaker>
					<line>But your father, now, </line>
					<line>Expects you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I'm too gallant, Sir; so tell him. </line>
					<line>I'll pay my duty to the Duchess first; </line>
					<line>Unto my---mother, since it must be so: </line>
					<line>And when we have discuss'd some words, why then </line>
					<line>I'll meet him. No more words, Sir.---Now, farewell!</line></sp>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Casti.</speaker>
					<line>My lord, you do me honour.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Sir, </line>
					<line>I do myself much honour thus to take </line>
					<line>A good man by the hand. You are not all </line>
					<line>Soldier, and yet enough: I do not love </line>
					<line>All courtier: I myself, you know, was once </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Julio.</speaker>
					<line>Oh!---</line>

					<line>If I am right, I saw him talk </line>

					<line>I'll bid him come to you.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Not so: stay, Sir. </line>
					<line>I'll wait for my son's leisure. He is tired </line>

					<line>He has a natural gaiety that sits </line>

					<stage>
						<strong>Isabella</strong> draws <strong>Julio</strong> aside. </stage>

					<line>Of late, </line>

					<line>Some secret sorrow wearing down his heart, </line>
					<line>Has paled his cheek, and thinned it: and at times, </line>
					<line>I've seen him fretted much beyond his custom.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed! then must it be </line>
					<line>The sun, (there is no cause beside,)---the Sun </line>
					<line>Hath burnt these humours on him, and perhaps </line>
					<line>Quickened the wholesome current of his blood, </line>
					<line>'Till it outruns it's channels:</line>
					<line>then, you know,</line>
					<line>Come fevers, and in the abused brain </line>

					<line>Shall I tell you?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Yes.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Listen to me, then. When you were young--- </line>
					<line>You are young still, and fair; the more's the pity: </line>
					<line>But in the time I speak of, you were just </line>
					<line>Bursting from childhood---with a face as fair </line>
					<line>As tho' you had look'd in Paradise, and caught </line>
					<line>It's early beauty: then, your smile was soft, </line>
					<line>As Innocence before it learns to love. </line>
					<line>And yet a woman's passion dwelt within </line>
					<line>Your heart, as warm as Love.---But I am wrong?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! no. I loved---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Indeed, indeed.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Well!---There was one who loved you too. He said </line>
					<line>That every hope he had rested on you. </line>
					<line>He worshipped you, as Idols are adored </line>
					<line>In countries near the sun. He gave his heart </line>
					<line>So absolutely up, that had he thought </line>
					<line>Then, that you would desert him, he'd have slain </line>
					<line>Himself before you. You were his home, his heaven, </line>
					<line>His wealth, his light, his mind, and life substantial. </line>
					<line>But then he went away to the fierce wars, </line>
					<line>(His honor was pledged for it,) and he left </line>
					<line>You with an oath upon your soul behind. </line>
					<line>'Twas said he died---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>One said he saw you fall.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>'Twas said he died, and that she grieved awhile, </line>
					<line>In virgin widowhood for him. At last, </line>
					<line>A Duke---a reigning Duke, with wintry hair, </line>
					<line>And subtle spirit, and---without a heart, </line>
					<line>Came wooing to her, and so---you do not heed me--- </line>
					<line>And so she dried her tears, and (tho' the youth </line>
					<line>Wrote that he lived,) she laugh'd, and left the son, </line>
					<line>To marry with the father.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>And you wrote </line>
					<line>To me?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>To you, and him.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>I feared 'twas so. </line>
					<line>Now Heaven help me; for I'm wound about</line>

					<line>Oh! I am worn, and broken down by grief.&#134; </line>
					<line>I dare not hope that you'll believe me, yet </line>
					<line>That letter, Guido---Oh, I never knew it; </line>
					<line>I had no letter---saw no letter.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>What! </line>
					<line>I wrote to you from Naples: from my bed </line>
					<line>Where I lay languishing, by Gaspero, </line>
					<line>My father's servant. Why, I wrote---(has there </line>
					<line>Been cozening here!)---unto my father:</line>
					<em>he</em>
					<line>Will not deny't. Where is that slave?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Gaspero? He is dead.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>He was my father's servant. Could he be </line>
					<line>Unfaithful? No.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Your father prized him much. </line>
					<line>Oh! it is too clear: we are both undone.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>It may be;---nay, it is. But, 'ere I sink, </line>
					<line>I will be righted some way, or revenged. </line>
					<line>What! does he think to cheat me now, and wear </line>
					<line>His prize abroad so boldly.---before<em>me</em>?</line>
					<line>I'll have revenge.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>He is your father, Guido. </line>
					<line>Nay---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I disown him. He has lost his son. </line>
					<line>Some parents shut their children from their homes, </line>
					<line>(Young boys and gentle girls) but<em>I</em>abjure</line>
					<line>My father in his age: let him go down </line>
					<line>Into his grave alone.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Do not incense him.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Whom?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>The Duke.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>You're right. </line>
					<line>Call him no more my father. No; I'll talk </line>
					<line>As one man with his equal; or, perhaps, </line>
					<line>I may wear something of superior scorn, </line>
					<line>And drop a word or two of charity; </line>
					<line>But that will be for thy sake, my poor girl! </line>
					<line>Nay, dry your tears: and let us part awhile.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>Farewell.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! not farewell yet. I but go </line>
					<line>To see the Duke. When shall we meet again?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>We must not; yet---</line>

					<line>We will, we will, once more.</line>

					<line>Hark!---hush! your father comes.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Why, that is well. </line>
					<line>We will (I'm glad of't) say at once good morrow, </line>
					<line>Without more ceremony.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Isid.</speaker>
					<line>No; not now, </line>

					<line>Hark! He stays long---but Isidora is </line>

					<line>Right: it is a cloak; </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Guido, by Heaven!--- </line>
					<line>But this---this is not well, my son, no more of it. </line>
					<line>I sent for you by the Confessor---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ay, </line>
					<line>That you may in my ear unload your mind </line>
					<line>Of some dark secret; what is't? Speak, my Lord. </line>
					<line>If you have done aught that may leave a blot </line>
					<line>On the bright annals of our house, confess, </line>
					<line>And I will be as secret as deceit. </line>
					<line>If you have been a tyrant,</line>
					<line>and enslaved</line>
					<line>The bodies or the minds of noble men, </line>
					<line>Why, let me know it: or, if you have been </line>
					<line>As poisonous as the serpent, or have mined, </line>
					<line>Mole-like, your way beneath your neighbour's house, </line>
					<line>And shook down all his happiness, confess it: </line>
					<line>Or if, like the wilderness creature, you have prey'd </line>
					<line>Even upon your young, I bid you still </line>
					<line>To tell me and take comfort.&#134;</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>I have been </line>
					<line>Silent, my son---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Not so, not so; and yet you were in truth: </line>
					<line>When slander came abroad, and I was absent, </line>
					<line>You kept a politic silence; thus I've heard: </line>
					<line>And, when I fell, you wept and kissed away </line>
					<line>The bright warm tears from Isidora's cheek. </line>
					<line>But I rose up again:---I rose, my lord, </line>
					<line>Up from my bed of battle, and while the blood </line>
					<line>Harden'd upon my wounds, I traced, with weak </line>
					<line>And shaking fingers, a poor scrawl, reminding </line>
					<line>Her of our love: you start? our love I said; </line>
					<line>And you---you kept it from her. Speak? was't so? </line>
					<line>There's no one to betray you: should you blush, </line>
					<line>I'll hush your virtue, like a murder, up.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Guido, you go too far: no more of this.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No more?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You'll anger me---I tell you this </line>
					<line>For the last time. My blood is hot as your's.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Much hotter. Noble lord, if I may speak---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You may not, Sir. Death! shall I stand and suffer </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Ah! Guido, this will bring </line>
					<line>Bitter repentance, in some after day; </line>
					<line>Till then be silent---still.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! I will be </line>
					<line>As silent as the grave you've dug for me. </line>
					<line>I'll be as wary as the fox, and subtle,</line>
					<line>But like the adder, when I'm questioned, deaf. </line>
					<line>And should you fall, (Princes may fall, my lord, </line>
					<line>As the red leaves in autumn,---nay in spring;) </line>
					<line>If your own tyranny, or others hate, </line>
					<line>Rebels at home, or cozening friends abroad, </line>
					<line>Or open foes should cast you down at last,--- </line>
					<line>Fear not; I will be there; close at your heart, </line>
					<line>Just like the canker when the tree decays.&#134;</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>When you have ended,---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I have said,---have done.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You have; and had I not </line>
					<line>Some of that kindly blood, which you deny, </line>
					<line>You must have spoken less. Guido, you </line>
					<line>Have done me shameful wrong; but I have been </line>
					<line>Patient,---as patient as my nature might: </line>
					<line>I have born words; such words as never prince </line>
					<line>Yet bore before from subject, or from son.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Perhaps,---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Speak out.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Perhaps, I have been warm; </line>
					<line>But, no,---no.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>As you please. Your humour turns </line>
					<line>Quickly as mine, it seems; but it shall be </line>
					<line>My humour to forget. If, after this, </line>
					<line>In your distemper'd judgment---but no more. </line>
					<line>---Your mother---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Ah! indeed no more, no more.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>The Duchess of Mirandola expects </line>
					<line>To see you. Come, I will go with you,---now.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I---I have seen her.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>So: 'twas well.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I bade </line>
					<line>Gheraldi tells you that I had gone thither.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>'Tis true; he told me (I remember now,) </line>
					<line>That you had gone to pay your duty there. </line>
					<line>She was rejoiced to see you?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No; not much.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>How? not rejoiced? it was not well to meet </line>
					<line>My son, and not rejoice; but you must pardon. </line>
					<line>She has been ill, and the full summer moon </line>
					<line>Sways at will women's fancies.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>You are gay.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Why not? I have my wife here, and my son </line>
					<line>The one is beautiful, the other brave. </line>
					<line>I have no curse that clings to me: no fear </line>
					<line>That enemies or</line>
					<line>friends can do me harm.</line>
					<line>There's not a traitor in the realm could live </line>
					<line>Now undetected.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Traitors! there are none.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! be not sure. When first the snake puts on </line>
					<line>His summer-skin, he looks not loathsome: 'tis </line>
					<line>When he's contract and wrinkled, we begin </line>
					<line>To fear or hate him.&#134;---But these things are not </line>
					<line>Fit for a day like this. We should be gay.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I'll do my best.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Who can ask more? Come then; </line>
					<line>We'll speak no more of the serpent; yet it was</line>
					<line>The circling emblem of eternity, </line>
					<line>And in its terrible folds this world and all </line>
					<line>Its host of strange and proud inhabitants, </line>
					<line>With proud men at the head, was compass'd once. </line>
					<line>If 'twere so now, it would be well, methinks, </line>
					<line>If the lithe thing would draw its sinuous shape </line>
					<line>Closer and closer, till---but I forget </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>You do in truth, my lord: </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Heed it not: </line>
					<line>I speculate at times, as well as you.&#134; </line>

					<line>Yet he's my son,---poor, poor Bianca's son. </line>
					<line>Shall I not curb my fretful nature, when </line>
					<line>I think of him?---Ah! yes---I'll strive to think </line>
					<line>Not ill of him.---He bears an honest shew. </line>
					<line>Were this a time for questioning, I'd ask </line>
					<line>Touching those letters, and Vitelli's plots--- </line>
					<line>'Tis not;---perhaps to-morrow. If he should </line>
					<line>Have been abused.---How much his pallid smile </line>
					<line>Shone like Bianca's. Oh! I'll love him yet; </line>
					<line>And he shall love me too: and yet---and yet--- </line>

					<line>It is.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Speak on. </line>
					<line>If you have suffered wrong and pray relief, </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! my lord, </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Why is this?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Why! have you aught to ask? if so, speak on.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>My lord, I know not how it is, but you </line>

					<line>You will not answer?---no?</line>

					<line>Go on, go on. </line>
					<line>I like your boldness,---not your spirit. Well!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>What have I done, my lord?</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>What done!---but speak.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>You think me traitor, as I hear; but surely </line>

					<line>Be not too sure. </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>That's as you will, my lord:---but away with this. </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I have not, by my hopes: nay, hear me swear--- </line>
					<line>If I have done---done what? I know not what. </line>
					<line>But if I ever gave you cause to hate me,--- </line>
					<line>If I have wronged you by myself, or e'er </line>
					<line>Conspired with others,---plotted, writ, or thought,--- </line>
					<line>Nay, if I ever heard of foes to you </line>
					<line>And lent them help or countenance---strike me down! </line>
					<line>I call on you, bright Heaven! I call on all </line>
					<line>Your terrible thunders and blue darting fires </line>
					<line>Quickly to come upon me. If my words </line>

					<line>Now we may go and pray.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Once more.---That ring--- </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Ha!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh! my lord, do not doubt me.---Once more, Sir, </line>
					<line>I ask you to remember what I was, </line>
					<line>And now believe.---My lord!---Nay,---not a word? </line>
					<line>Not one?---Then is my purpose strong. My lord, </line>
					<line>I see that 'tis in vain to hope to stay </line>
					<line>In quiet at Mirandola. Each hour </line>
					<line>Would bring a host of troubles and of fears </line>
					<line>On me,---or both, perhaps: and I've enough </line>
					<line>Therefore, unless your highness orders that </line>
					<line>I must remain, I purpose speedily </line>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>This is sudden. </line>

					<line>Perhaps you may hear further from me there.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Yet say farewell.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Farewell.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Oh, Father, I </line>

					<line>Which now I stretch abroad towards you,---now, </line>
					<line>You'll never touch again.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Farewell!---Mountains and seas </line>
					<line>Must rise and roll between us: then, perhaps, </line>
					<line>We may be friends again. I loved you once--- </line>
					<line>Once for your mother's sake; ay, for your own. </line>
					<line>I had brave hopes, but you have blighted them;--- </line>
					<line>But I may write to Rome.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I hope you will.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>If what I think is wrong: no matter, you </line>
					<line>Shall hear from me at Rome.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>At Rome, then.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>If </line>
					<line>My power, or my purse be wanting---ever, </line>
					<line>(Death! I shall play the fool!)---if ever I </line>
					<line>Can serve you, let me know, and 't shall be done. </line>
					<line>This from my old affection will I do. </line>
					<line>Some one has used me ill---some one has struck </line>
					<line>And tortured me. Let me look on you.---You </line>
					<line>Had always a brave look;---ay, from a boy.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I wore my innocence there, and in my heart.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Well, well; no more; you'll see the Duchess ere </line>
					<line>You leave us.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>No, my lord.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>You'll see her? Nay---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>'Tis better not. I leave Mirandola </line>
					<line>To-night.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>But first---</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>Pray, spare me.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Then---why then </line>
					<line>Fare you well, Guido; for it must come to that </line>
					<line>At last.---Farewell! yet, wheresoe'er you go, </line>
					<line>Still do not quite forget Mirandola. </line>
					<line>You have had happy hours and pleasant thoughts, </line>
					<line>And I---I have had some: in infancy </line>
					<line>I---(tho' I was a prince) would not confide </line>
					<line>My son to hirelings. I have stood and watched </line>
					<line>You sleeping, (then I dared not own you, for </line>
					<line>My father lived,) while poor Bianca wept. </line>
					<line>Oh! I have watch'd you with a cotter's care, </line>
					<line>Thro' many and many a night:---'tis so; and now </line>
					<line>Mountains and stormy seas will come between </line>
					<line>Our hearts. While you are wandering, I shall be </line>
					<line>Shut in my palace,---prisoned up,---a slave: </line>
					<line>What else are princes ever? but I'll write </line>
					<line>To Rome.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>
					<line>I shall expect it.</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Confide in me. </line>
					<line>I thought I had a word or two to say, </line>
					<line>But they are gone;---the common things, perhaps, </line>
					<line>Men say at parting: likely nothing more. </line>
					<line>You may return: if not, why let us part </line>
					<line>Like friends at least: hate is a galling load </line>
					<line>To bear in absence; so---farewell. Oh! Guido! </line>
					<stage>Embraces him.</stage>
					<line>And now, no more. Farewell!</line>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Guido.</speaker>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Duke.</speaker>
					<line>Farewell! The kindest breath of Heaven </line>
					<line>Rest on your head and hallow it.---My son! </line>

					<line>How<em>I have</em>loved him let these tremulous hands</line>
					<line>Proclaim, and these my weeping woman's eyes, </line>
					<line>Not often stained with tears.---Farewell, once more. </line>
					<line>Son of my youth! And now I'll take one look </line>
					<line>At the blue sky, and taste the scents which hang </line>
					<line>Around the flowers.---Methinks I feel again </line>

					<line>There is a fate in this.</line>
					<line>I seem to go</line>
					<line>Calmly, yet with a melancholy step, </line>
					<line>Onwards and onwards.---Is there not a tale </line>
					<line>Of some man, (an Arabian as I think,) </line>

					<line>Tossing about, the sport of winds and waters, </line>
					<line>Until he saw an isle, towards which his ship </line>
					<line>Turned suddenly?---there is: and he was drawn, </line>
					<line>As by a magnet on, slowly, until </line>
					<line>The vessel neared the isle: and then, it flew </line>
					<line>Quick as a shooting star, and dash'd itself </line>
					<line>To pieces. Methinks I am this man.&#134;---But be it. </line>

					<line>We'll make the best of life.</line>
					<line>Poor policy</line>
					<line>It is to shun the few bright hours that come, </line>

					<line>(Pardon for this devotion's sake,) that I </line>
					<line>Ever pronounced a word that look'd like anger, </line>

					<line>Gone. She will return </line>

				</head>
				<sp><speaker>Miss Foote</speaker>
					<line><strong>Ladies</strong>!---Excuse me that I live---but I</line>
					<line>Implored the Poet not to let me die; </line>
					<line>An author's fate, I urged, would do as well,--- </line>
					<line>To be alive, and but insensible.</line>
					<line>No Epilogue is written, so you may guess </line>
					<line>The Poet's and the Manager's distress:--- </line>
					<line>I've seen much mingled fury and despair, </line>
					<line>Stamping of feet, and tearing of the hair, </line>
					<line>Lines penn'd and blotted out,---old verses read </line>
					<line>To see what earlier Epilogues have said: </line>
					<line>But not a couplet could their favour win,--- </line>
					<line>The deepest Tragedy is there,---within. </line>
					<line>I, by the Manager's entreaty press'd, </line>
					<line>Come to implore your hearts for the distrest. </line>
					<line>It is not very willingly I do't, </line>
					<line>But Mr. Fawcett says, "They'll hear Miss Foote!"</line> <line>And will you
						hear her?---You have thought perchance </line>
					<line>She scarce<em>should</em>speak after so deep a trance;---</line>
					<line>But women love last words---the best of all. </line>
					<line>Faintness and speech are not unnatural,--- </line>
					<line>Meek Desdemona, as I've heard and read, </line>
					<line>(True woman!) "spake, after long seeming<em>dead</em>!"</line>
					<line>Then may not I throw off my death-like grief, </line>
					<line>And talk a little,---merely for relief?</line> <line>How like you this our
						play?---be candid---come--- </line>
					<line>Say, is the Tragic Muse at all at home?--- </line>
					<line>'Tis said large Theatres the Drama mar,--- </line>
					<line>At least some<em>little ones</em>keep up this war;</line>
					<line>But oh! I love the wondrous scene,---the dress,--- </line>
					<line>The state, that lends to sorrow, mightiness. </line>
					<line>Give me to see ennobled Tragedy </line>
					<line>In proud magnificence go sweeping by--- </line>
					<line>Her royal beauty deepen'd---and her grace </line>
					<line>Made awful by fit circumstance and place! </line>
					<line>No niggard stage becomes her gorgeous gloom; </line>
					<line>Her soul, as King John says, wants elbow room.</line> <line>But I forget
						my duty to the play, </line>
					<line>And custom disregard;---what shall I say?--- </line>
					<line>Let me recal to mind some sterling rhyme </line>
					<line>Of an "approved good master" of his time--- </line>
					<line>"When Learning's triumphs o'er her barbarous foes </line>
					<line>"First rear'd the stage"---a plague on't---I must close </line>
					<line>This sombre task. I really cannot speak </line>
					<line>The Epilogue---I'll learn one by next week.</line> <line>In the meantime,
						kind friends, allow our play </line>
					<line>To live without it till another day.</line></sp>
