               SCENE I.
               Scene—An Apartment in Whitehall.
               Enter Ireton, Harrison, and Pride, to Downes and
                           Marten.
                     
               
                  
                     Downes.
                  
                  Welcome to London,Ireton! dearly welcome
                  To fair Whitehall!
                     Harrison!
                     Pride!Where loiters
                  The valiant General?
               
               
                  Ireton.
                  He alighted with us
                  Three hours agone.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  What, three hours here, and still
                  In harness! Know ye not your coat of mail
                  Is out of date? Go, doff your armour quick,
                  Provide ye civil suits, grave civil suits,
                  Sad reverend civil suits.
               
               
                  Pride.
                  What mean'st thou?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Seek
                  Meaning of Harry Marten! Tush! Where
                     tarries
                  The piousCromwell?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He is busied still
                  Disposing the tired soldiery.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Disbanding
                  Will be his business soon. The lubbard people,
                  And the smug citizens, are grown aweary
                  Of this rough war. Ye must learn gentler trades
                  If ye would thrive. Peace is the cry, my masters;
                   Peace and the King!
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The Newport treaty speeds;
                  So far is sure.
               
               
                  Harrison.
                  But we bring victory,
                  To the good cause. Cromwell hath passed careering
                  From hold to hold, sweeping as with a besom
                  
                  The foul malignants from the land. The
                        North
                  
                  Is ours from sea to sea.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  'Tis a brave leader;
                  But peace is ever the best victory.
               
               Enter Cromwel.
               
                  Mar.
                  In good time comes the General. Valiant Cromwell
                  
                  Thy praise was on our lips.
               
               
                  Cromwell.
                  Not mine! not mine!
                  Praise to the Lord of Hosts, whose mighty shield
                  Bucklered us in the battle, whose right arm
                  Strengthened us when we smote! Praise to the Lord!
                  For his poor instruments, the meanest soldier
                  Doth his great duty; we no more. My masters,
                  Have ye no news astir? News, the prime staple
                  Of yonder tattling city?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Aye; the worst
                  Is that the Commons grow from day to day
                  More doubtful of the army, more possessed
                  By canting presbyters.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Name not the Commons,
                  A jealous crew, whose envious hate descends
                  'Twixt every pause of fear on us their loathed
                  Despised defenders. Were there but one head
                  To the whole army, they would turn to truth
                  An elder tyrant's wish, and chop it off.
                  Despots who prate of liberty!—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Worse! worse!
                  A godless yet intolerent crew, who rear
                  O'er the down-fallen Church that blacker idol
                  A conscience-fettering Presbytery.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  They shall be quelled. Power, howsoever called,
                  Is still the subtlest snare the Tempter weaves
                  For man's frail sinful soul. Save me from power!
                  Grant me to follow still, a lowly soldier
                  In the great cause! The Commons shall be
                     quelled.
                  What other news?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The best is that the King
                  
                  And the Commissioners draw near a godly
                  And salutary peace. The King hath bent
                  His will in a wise humbleness; and now—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I joy to hear thee say so. What! the Lord
                  Hath turned his heart, and he hath yielded up
                  His haughtyprelates, his ill councillors,
                  The popish mummery of his chapel?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Nay,
                  Not yet; but he hath promised.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Promised! Oh
                  The King hath promised!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Well?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And ye believe?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Would'st have us doubters?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  In good sooth, not I!
                  Believe who can! yet ere ye set him free
                  Look to the stuffing of his saddle, search
                  The waste leaves of his prayer-book, lest ye find
                  Some vow to Henrietta, some shrewd
                     protest,
                  Some antedated scroll to throw the shadow
                  Of a plain lie before his words. Search! search!
                  It is a prudent King, that casts about him
                  To rid him of his enemies. Search, I say.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Why,Cromwell, thou art bitter.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Heaven forfend!
                  I liked Charles Stuart well. I am of the
                     fools
                  Whom Habit counts amidst her slaves; that love,
                  For old acquaintance sake, each long-known pest
                  And close familiar evil. I liked him well;
                  The better that his proud disgracious speech
                  Seemed to my plain and downright simpleness
                  As honest as mine own. Ye all remember
                  What friends we were at Holmby. Harrison
                  
                  And e'en my loving kinsman deemed I waxed
                  Faint in the cause. But rightly it is written
                  In the one Holy Book, Put not thy trust
                  In Princes.Cromwell refers to the time in 1647 when he and his army held Charles I in palatial captivity at Holmby House in Northamptonshire. In commenting "what friends we were" may be referring to the considerable attentions provided for the King's comfort even while under military observation.
                  
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Yet is he in 
                     Carisbooke
                  
                  A present danger. Round yon prison isle
                  
                  Lurk spies and plots and treasons. Every breeze
                  Comes pregnant with quick rumours; every ear
                  Is bent to listen; every eye is turned
                  On those grey walls.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I grant ye. But astir,
                  Free as the breeze to traverse sea and land,
                  Creep in our councils, sweep across our camps,
                  Were the King harmless then? Yet thou art right;
                  He's dangerous in Carisbrooke.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Dismiss him;
                  Send him abroad unkinged; or drive him forth
                  As Amaziah.
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                     (Aside)
                  Ha! And they slew him!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  What, send him to seek succour in each court,
                  From papal Rome to savage
                     Muscovy,
                  Till he shall burst on us in triumph, heading
                  
                     Europe's great armament.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Wert thou a soldier,
                  And in this cause, thou would'st cry Welcome, Marten,
                  To such an armament.
               
               
                  Har.
                  With His great help.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, with His help and in this cause, if union
                  Dwelt in the land. But this is idle talk.
                  The King is dangerous; dangerous on the throne,
                  Dangerous in prison, dangerous abroad,
                  At home and everywhere. Yet this is idle.
                  We must abide the
                     Commons' treaty.
                  
               
               
                  Har.
                  Wherefore
                  Lifts not the army the strong hand of
                     power
                  Over these stiff-necked rulers? Put them down.
                  Tread out the firebrands.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Rather move the Commons
                  
                  To bring the King to trial.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Who said that?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  'Twas bravely spoken.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Who said that?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The words
                  Sounded like treason.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir, had we met here
                  To compass such intent, the very thought
                  Had been a treason. But the words fell straight
                  Midst our unconscious hearts, unprompted, quick,
                  Startling even him who spake them—-like the fire
                  That it the Burning Bush. A sign from Heaven!
                  Direct from Heaven! A comfortable light
                  To our benighted spirits! As I wrestled
                  
                     In prayer this morning, when I would have cried
                  For mercy on Charles Stuart, my parched
                     tongue
                  Clave to my mouth. A token from on high!
                  A star lit up to guide us!
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Yet the Commons
                  
                  Will scarcely echo this rapt strain. The King
                  
                  Hath friends amongst us.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Fear not. He who sent
                  This impulse on his servants will know how
                  To turn all hearts.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Ye will not slay the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Life hangs not on our lips. Yet surely, Sir,
                  I hope to spare him. Friends, we must not sleep
                  Over such stirring business. Downes, go
                     thou
                  For Bradshaw, that resolved and learned and wise
                  And godly law-man. Thou art like to find him
                  At the Guildhall. Say we would speak
                     with him.
                  (Exit Downes.)
                  
                     Harrison!—Downes went
                     forth as one who loves not
                  His errand—Lacks he zeal? 'Tis a brave soldier,
                  And yet—Follow him, Marten; and return
                  With Bradshaw hither. We shall need
                     thy counsel.
                  Delay not.—
                   (Exit Marten.)
                  
                     Harrison! thou truest soldier
                  Of the good cause, to thee we trust the charge
                  Of guarding our great prisoner. Make thee ready
                  For a swift journey. I'll confer with thee
                  Alone afore thou goest.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Should I not see
                  The General?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore? Hence.
                  (Exit Harrison.)
                  
                     (To Pride)
                  Nay, Colonel, go not!
                  I'd speak with thee, good Colonel. Rest thee, son,
                  I'd speak with this good Colonel.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  I attend
                  Your Excellency's pleasure.
               
               (During the next few speeches Cromwell walks up and down the stage, now speaking to himself, now looking at the weather, now asking questions, without attending to the answers, evidently absorbed in thought.)
               
                  Crom.
                  
                  Aye, the light
                  Mercurial Harry Marten said but sooth;
                  They are unripe for this great charge. It shall be—
                  And yet—What is the hour?
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Upon the stroke
                  Of one.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He listens not. Look how he searches
                  The weather with unseeing eyes.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis stormy.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Nay a bright day.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  He hears not.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sweep them off,
                  And the whole game is ours! But—Which way blows
                  The wind?
               
               
                  Pride.
                  Right from the south.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  It must be, shall be.
                  
                     Ireton, I gave thee yesterday a scroll
                  Of the malignants in the Commons>—Hark ye!
                  The Commons, our great masters! If Charles
                        Stuart
                  
                  Have friends in England, he will find them there
                  'Mid those self-seekers.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Wherefore not arraign
                  The King before the Council?.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                     Sir, we need
                  The Commons' name. I would not that our just
                  And righteous cause lacked any form of law
                  To startle tender consciences. I have thought
                  Afore of this. Didst never see the thrasher
                  Winnow the chaff from the full grain? Good Colonel,
                  Thyself shalt play the husbandman to cleanse
                  This sample of foul corn. Take yonder scroll,
                  And with a troop of horse, go post thyself
                  Beside the Commons' door, and seize each man
                  Whose name stains that white parchment. Treat all well,
                  But let none enter.
               
               
                  Pri.
                  And my warrant?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  My word. If any question, say the General—
               
               
                  Pri.
                  
                     Lord Fairfax?
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, the good Lord General
                  Shall hear of thy good service. Fear it not.
                  Myself shall tell him. Thy good service, dearer
                  Than half a dozen battles; better worth
                  And richlier guerdoned. Haste! Lord Grey of
                        Groby
                  
                  Will aid thee to detect the knaves. Away!
                  Full many a goodly manor shall change masters
                  To-morrow 'fore the sequestrators.
               
               (Exit Pride.)
               
                  Ire.
                  So!
                  That work will be well done.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I loathe myself
                  That I employ the mercenary tool;
                  But we are in our great aims justified,
                  Our high and holy purpose. Saints and prophets
                  Have used uncleanly instruments. Good son,
                  Keep between Fairfaxand these men. The weak
                  
                     Wife-ridden faintling would demur and dally,
                  
                     And pause at every step, and then draw back,
                  Unapt for good or ill. He must know nought.
                  Re-enter Harrison and Pride.
                  
                  What make ye here again?
               
               
                  Pri.
                  Dost thou not hear?
                  A mutiny amongst the soldiers.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Nay,
                  But half a score malignants, who would fain
                  Stir up the soldiery.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And they?
               
               
                  Har.
                  They listen,
                  But move not.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Seize the traitors. Shoot them dead;
                  If any murmur, still them too. Let death
                  Follow offence as closely as the sound
                  Of the harquebuss the flash. Art thou not gone?
                  What stops thee?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Be more merciful.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why this
                  Is mercy. If thou saw'st one, match in hand
                  Approach a mine hollowed beneath some rich
                  And populous town, would'st strike him down at once,
                  Or wait till he had fired the train.
               
               
                  Har.
                  At once!
                  At once!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Well?—Go thou too, fair son! away!
                  I'll follow on the instant. Look I find
                  The guilty quiet.
                  Exeunt HarrisonandIreton.
                  
                  We have been too easy
                  And fostered malcontents. Yet this swift vengeance
                  
                     Will strike a wholesome terror, and the echo
                  May reach to higher miscreants. Good Colonel,
                  Thou loiterest overlong. Go, block the door
                  And let none pass. Be sure thou let none pass.
                  I must to yon poor traitors. Let none pass.
               
               Exeunt.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               —An Apartment in Carisbrooke
                        Castle.
               The KingandHerbert
               
               
                  King.
                  Herbert!
               
               
                  Herbert.
                  My liege.
               
               
                  King.
                  Put up my book. I wait
                  The grave Commissioners, and to be seen
                  
                     Poring o'er Shakespeare's page—Oh heinous sin!
                  Inexpiable deadly sin!
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Your Grace
                  Speaks cheerily.
               
               
                  King.
                  Why I have fed my thoughts
                  On the sweet woodland tale, the lovely tale
                  Of 
                        
                           Ardenne
                           Arden
                        
                        Forest, till the peaceful end,
                  The gentle comfortable end, hath
                     bathed
                  My very heart in sunshine. We are here
                  Banished as the old Duke, and friends come round,
                  And foes relent, and calm Forgiveness hangs,
                  An Angel, in the air, to drop her balm
                  On all our wounds. I thank thee, royal spirit,
                  Thrice princely poet, from whose lightest scene
                  Kings may draw comfort. Take yon sprig of bay
                  And lay between the leaves. I marvel much
                  Where loiter the Commissioners.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Your Grace
                  Hath vanquished them so often that they creep
                  Fearfully to the field—a beaten foe.
               
               
                  King.
                  
                     Nay, we are near agreed. I have granted more
                  Than they durst think for. They set forth to day
                  Bearing my answer to the Commons. Look
                  To see a sudden peace. Many will deem
                  I have yielded overmuch; but I keep quick
                  The roots of kingly power, albeit the boughs
                  Be shrewdly lopt. And then to see again
                  My wife, my children, to reward my poor
                  And faithful servants, to walk free, to reign!
                  Look to see sudden peace.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  
                  Yet, Sire—forgive my fear!—would thou hadst ta'en
                  The proffered means of safety, had escaped
                  This Island prison!
               
               
                  King.
                  What! when I had pledged
                  My word, my royal word! Fie! fie! good Herbert;
                  Better, if danger were, a thousand fold
                  Perish even here than forfeit that great bond
                  Of honour, a King's word. Fie! fie! Yet sooth
                  Thou mean'st me kindly, Herbert. Ha, the Sea,
                  That day and night hath chased so angrily,
                  Breaking around us with so wild a coil,
                  An elemental warder, smiles again,
                  Merrily dancing in the cold keen light
                  Of the bright wintery Sun. We shall have boats
                  From England.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  One hath landed, Sire.
               
               
                  King.
                  And they
                  May bear my message without pause. Who comes?
               
               (Enter Hammond.)
               
                  Ham
                  May't please you, Sire, the high Commissioners
                  
                  Crave audience of your Majesty.
               
               
                  King.
                  Admit them.
                  
                     Enter Lord Salisbury, Lord Say, Sir Harry
                        Vane, and other Commissioners,
                     some of them Ministers.
                  
                  See, Vane hath lost his
                           frown! We shall have peace.
                  
                  Good morrow my good Lord of Salisbury!
                  Lord Say, Sir Harry Vane, and gentles all,
                  A fair good morrow. The sun smiles at last
                  Upon our meeting.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Sunshine after storm;
                  A happy omen, Sire, a type of peace.
               
               
                  Salis.
                  Yet clouds are gathering.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Tush! the noon-day sun
                  Will overcome them.
               
               
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Cease this heathenish talk
                  Of omens. Hath your grace prepared your answer
                  To the proposals of the Commons?
               
               
                  King.
                  Reach
                  Yon paper Herbert.
                     Set ye forth to-day?
               
               
                  Vane.
                  With the next tide.
               
               
                  King.
                  So speed ye wind and wave,
                  And send ye swiftly hence, and swiftlier back
                  Blest messengers of peace, winged like the dove 
                  That bore the olive token. Take my answer,
                  A frank compliance with each article
                  Save twain, save only twain.
               
               
                  Say.
                  And they—I pray thee
                  Be wholly gracious, Sire! Peril not thus
                  Your country's weal, your freedom, and your crown,
                  By timeless reservation.
               
               
                  King.
                  I have yielded
                  Power and prerogative, and state and wealth
                  For my dear country. All that was mine own
                  All that was mine to give, I freely gave;
                  That I withhold is of the conscience. Look
                  
                     On these white hairs, and think if one so signed
                  Marked for the grave, may for the vain respect
                  Of crowns or kingdoms offer up his friends
                  Or his old worship. Mark me: I'll not yield
                  A man of that devoted seven, nor bate
                  A word of my accustomed prayer, to save
                  My lips from cankering fetters, or win back
                  That velvet prison, a throne. No more of this.
                  Bear ye the treaty, Sirs; and use but half
                  That goodly gift of eloquence for me
                  That ye to me have shown, and be but heard
                  With half the grace, and we shall meet full soon& we shall meet full soon,
                  Subject and King, in peace, in blessed peace.—
                  
                     Harrison heard without.
                  Whoso asks entrance with so wild a din?
                  Give him admittance quickly.
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Yet, my liege,
                  For these seven cavaliers—
               
               
                  King.
                  No more! No more!
                  Thou hast my answer.—By the iron tread
                  A soldier.
               
               Enter Harrison.
               
                  Salis.
                  
                     Harrison! What brings
                     thee hither?
               
               
                  Har.
                  A sad and solemn message to your prisoner.
               
               
                  King.
                  Speak out thy tidings. Speak thine errand, Sir.
                  I am strong-hearted. Sovran privilege
                  Of them that tower so high!—Strong as yon eagle
                  That nests among the cliffs. I have borne loads
                  That would have sunk a meaner man in gulphs
                  Of deep despair. Thine errand. Stop! Who sent thee?
               
               
                  Har.
                  The Commons
               
               
                  King.
                  Now thine errand.
               
               
                  Har.
                  To demand
                  
                     The body of Charles Stuart,
                     sometime King
                  Of England—
               
               
                  King.
                  Sometime King?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Whom I attach
                  Of treason.
               
               
                  King.
                  Treason and the King! Off, Sir!
                  I warn thee touch me not. Some natures feel
                  A shuddering loathing of cold-blooded worms,
                  Snakes, aspics, vipers, toads—my flesh doth creep
                  And shiver if the reptile man approach
                  Too closely. Show thy warrant.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Look you, Sir,
                  The warrant be obeyed.
               
               
                  Vane.
                  Dost thou not see 
                  (to Salisbury)
                  The master hand of Cromwell in this deed? 
                  (to Harrison)
                  Where is the General?
               
               
                  Har.
                  Come victorious home—
                  Know'st thou not that?—to lend his pious aid
                  To our great work.
               
               
                  Salis.
                  But thou art from the Commons, 
                  Not from the Council,—sure thou saidst the Commons?
                  And they were earnest for the treaty.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Aye,
                  But in that goodly field grew tares, rank tares,
                  Which have been weeded out: stiffpresbyters,
                  Bitter malignants, and those sons of wrath
                  Who falter in the better path— dead boughs
                  Upon a noble tree. Some fifty horse
                  Swept off the rubbish.
               
               
                  Say.
                  But the men are safe? 
               
               
                  Har.
                  Even as thyself.
               
               (to the King)
               
                  Now, sir, hast thou enough
                  Studied yon parchment?
               
               
                  King.
                  Treason! to arraign
                  A crowned King of treason! I am here
                  
                     Treating with these same Commons on the faith, 
                  The general faith of nations. I appeal
                  To ye, my foes; to thee, my gaoler. What!
                  Stand ye all mute? high lords and learned lawmen,
                  And reverend ministers? Ye had glib tongues
                  For subtle argument, and treasonous craft,
                  And cobweb sophistry. Have ye no word
                  For faith, for honour? not one word? Shame! shame!
               
               
                  Vane.
                  We are the Commons'
                     servants, and must needs
                  Obey their mandates.
               
               
                  Say.
                  Yet with grief of heart—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Silence!
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye, silence! Sir, I thank thee yet
                  That sparest me that sharpest injury
                  A traitor's pity. For that gentle deed
                  I yield me gently to thy hands. Lead on
                  Where'er thou wilt; I follow.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Straight to London. 
                  To bide thy trial.
               
               
                  King.
                  What! will they dare that?
                  Doth not the very thought, the very word
                  Appal the rebels? Trial! When we meet
                  Confronted in that regal Hall, the King
                  And his revolted subjects, whoso then
                  Shall be the Judge? The King. Whoso make inquest,
                  Whoso condemn, and whoso fling a pardon,
                  A scornful pardon on your heads? The King,
                  The King, I tell ye, Sirs. Come on! I pant
                  To meet these Judges. For ye, solemn mockers, 
                  Grave men of peace, deceivers or deceived,
                  Sincere or false boots little, fare ye well! 
                  Yet give me yon vain treaty—Now, by Heaven
                  I shame to have communed with ye!—This slight paper,
                  That shivers at a touch, is tough and firm
                  Mated with such as ye. Bear to the Commons,
                  Your masters, yon torn fragments, fitting type 
                  Of their divided factions!—fitting type
                  Of ye, men of a broken faith! Farewell!
                  I wait thy pleasure, Sir.
               
               END OF THE FIRST ACT.
               
            
         
         
            ACT II.
            
               SCENE I.
               Scene—The Painted Chamber. A table at which
                     are seated Commissioners, Lawyers, &c.;  A gothic window behind the table, through which objects that pass may be seen.
               
                  Bradshaw, Fairfax, Ireton, Downes, Cook,
                     Marten, Tichburn, &c. Fairfax comes forward, followed by
                           Bradshaw, Ireton,
                        and Downes.
               
                  Fairfax.
                  Soon as the day be fixed, apprize me, Sirs;
                  The halberdiers shall wait ye.
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  Good my lord
                  Thou wilt not leave us? When did Fairfax
                     fly
                  A post of danger? And his honoured name
                  Stands foremost in our roll.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Sir, I am sworn
                  The soldier of the Commons, and as soldier
                  Obey them loyally. All that ye need
                  For state or for defence in this sad pageant
                  Our camp shall furnish. Save their General,
                  You may command the army. For this trial
                  I like it not. I am no gownsman. Sirs,
                  The halberdiers shall wait ye.
               
               (Exit Fairfax.)
               
                  Mar.
                  
                     What a nice
                  And peevish conscience Fairfax bears! Will
                     send
                  Arms, horses, men, to escort the prisoner, line
                  The Court, defend the judges, guard the scaffold—
                  If so our wisdom wills—yet hold himself
                  Content and harmless, so his single voice
                  Swell not the general doom.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Yet 'tis a wise
                  And noble gentleman.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Tush! a good sword-blade,
                  Keen in the field, but at the council dull
                  And heavy as the scabbard.
                  Enter Cromwell.
                  Lo! where comes
                  One whose bright spirit knows no dimness. Cromwell!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hear ye the news my masters? Harrison,
                  That bold and zealous soldier of our Israel,
                  Is here.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Where is the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The King of Kings
                     A New Testament epithet for Christ, who is called the King of Kings in Revelations 17:2 ("the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.") See also Revelations 19:16.
                  
                  Delivers him unto us. Harrison
                  
                  Awaits his landing. We must be prepared
                  For instant trial. Glad am I and proud
                  To greet with looks so firm and resolute
                  This full and frequent council.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Yet you met
                  A great one who forsakes us.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The Lord General?
                  Why on the battle-day such loss might cause
                  An hour's perplexity. Now—Hark ye Sirs!
                  Passing awhile Lord Fairfax's door I saw
                  The Queen.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  
                     In England! Didst thou see her face?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. But I knew her by the wanton curls,
                  The mincing delicate step of pride, the gait
                  Erect and lofty. 'Twas herself, I say,
                  Vain Jezabel
                     !
               
               
                  Dow.
                  At Fairfax's gate! Alas!
                  Poor lady!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (Aside)
                  Ha! And must we watch thee too?
                  
                  No word of this good Sirs.
                  (going to the table)
                  Why master Cook
                  
                  What needs this long indictment? Seems to me
                  Thou dost mistake our cause. The crime is not
                  A trivial larceny, where some poor thief
                  Is fenced and hemmed in by a form of words
                  In tedious repetition, endless links
                  Of the strong chain of law, lest at some loophole
                  The paltry wretch escape. We try a King,
                  In the stern name of Justice. Fling aside
                  These cumbering subtleties, this maze of words,
                  And in brief homely phrase, such as the soldier
                  May con over his watchfire, or the milk-maid
                  Wonderingly murmur as she tends her kine,
                  Or the young boy trace in his first huge scroll,
                  Or younger girl sew in her sampler, say
                  That we arraign Charles Stuart King of England
                  For warring on his people. Let this deed
                  Be clear and open as beseems the men
                  On whom the Lord hath set his seal. Besides
                  That will let loose thy stream of eloquence
                  Ice-bound by this cold freezing plea. What says
                  
                     Our learned President?

                     Thou art right. Thou art right.
                  Our fair intent needs not a veil. Be sure
                  He shall have noble trial and speedy, such
                  As may beseem a King.

                  He hears thee not. His sense rejects
                  All sound save that for which with such intense
                  And passionate zeal he listens. See his cheek
                  Quivers with expectation. Its old hue
                  Of ruddy brown is gone.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hark! Hark! my masters!
                  He is come! He is come! We are about to do
                  A deed which shall draw on us
                        questioning eyes
                  From the astonished nations. Men shall gaze
                  Afeared and wondering on this spot of earth,
                  As on a comet in the Heavens, fatal
                  To Kings of old. Start ye? Why at the first
                  
                     I started, as a man who in a dream
                  Sees indistinct and terrible grim forms
                  Of death and danger float before his glazed
                  And wondering eyes; but then as one who wakes
                  The inspiring light fell on me, and I saw
                  The guiding hand of Providence visibly
                  Beckoning to the great combat. We are His soldiers
                  Following the Cloud by day, the Fire by night:—
                  And shall we not be constant? We are arrayed
                  Against the stiff combined embodied spirits
                  Of prelacy and tyranny:—Shall we not
                  Be bold?
                  (The King, Herbert, 
                  Harrison, &c. pass the window)
                  See! See! he passes! So shall pass
                  The oppressor from the earth. His very shadow
                  The very traces of his foot are gone,
                  And the English ground is free, the English air
                  Free, free!—All praise be to His mighty name!
                  This is the crowning work.

                  SCENE II.
               —A Gallery leading to the 
                     King's
                           Prison.
               The Queen, Lady Fairfax, a
                  Centinel.
               
                  Lady Fairfax.
                  Another guard! The pass-word that hath served us
                  Through court, and gate, and hall, will fail us here;
                  This is the immediate prison of the King.
                  Say, Royal Madam, had we best accost
                  Yon centinel?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  The prison of the King!
                  And I have lived to hear those words that pierce
                  
                     My heart like daggers spoken familiarly
                  As she would say good day or fare ye well!
                  The prison of the King! England hath
                     been
                  His prison—but this one leads—My Lady Fairfax
                  
                  Command him to admit us.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  He draws nigh.
               
               
                  Centinel.
                  Fair mistresses how won ye here? This gallery
                  Leads to the prisoner's chambers.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  We would see him.
                  Admit us.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Be ye frenetic? Know ye not
                  That, save the Lords Commissioners none dare
                  Approach the prisoner?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Say the King.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Who art thou
                  That speak'st with such command?
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Know'st thou not me?
                  Thy General's wife.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  I am of Cromwell's soldiers,
                  And own no woman's rule.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Admit us, slave!
                  I am the Queen, thy Queen, the Queen of
                        England!
                  Make way.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  Stand back I say.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I am a wife
                  Seeking her husband in his prison. Soldier,
                  If thou have a man's heart!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Here's money for thee—
                  Admit her.
               
               
                  Cent.
                  I have fought in twenty fields
                  A veteran of the cause. Put up your gold.
                  And, madam, please you home!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Here is my home,—
                  My husband's prison gate. I'll live here, die here,
                  
                     Here will I watch without as he within,
                  Till death, the great deliverer comes to free
                  The captives. This shall be my grave. Charles!Charles!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Peace! Peace!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I thought I heard him. Charles! myCharles!
                  My King! My Husband!
               
               
                  Cent.
                  There are many chambers
                  Between thee and the King. I prythee hence!
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Madam, take patience.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Charles! He must be
                     dead
                  Already that he answers not.
               
               Enter Cromwell.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  What means
                  This clamourous din of female tongues so near
                  The prison of the King? The Lady Fairfax!
                  
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Cromwell!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                     The Queen!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Cromwell I hated thee,
                  Yet open yonder door, and I'll pray for thee
                  All my life long. Yon churlish centinel—
               
               
                  Crom.

                  Queen.
                  Be quick! Be quick!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The word is Naseby.
                  
               
               
                  Queen.
                  On!
                  Be quick. Be quick!
               
               (Exeunt Queen and Centinel )
               
                  Crom.
                  Now my good Lady Fairfax,
                  Right well beseemeth christian charity
                  To succour them that suffer; howsoe'er
                  Midst strict professors it may breed some marvel
                  That one so famed for rigid sanctity,
                  The gravest matron of the land should herd
                  With yonder woman.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  
                     With the Queen?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  A papist;
                  A rank Idolater; a mumming masquer;
                  A troller of lewd songs; a wanton dancer;
                  A vain upholder of that strength of Satan
                  
                  The playhouse. They that be so eminent
                  As thou will find maligners; 'tis the curse
                  Of our poor fallen nature. Be not seen
                  Hovering about these walls. I speak in love
                  Of the Lord General.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  The Lord General,
                  And many a godly minister, and I,
                  Weak woman though I be, mourn that these walls
                  Should come between the Kingand people. Peace
                  Had been a holier bond.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Peace! that our General
                  The good Lord Fairfax, Captain of the guard,
                  Should tend the popish ladies to their mass;—
                  A high promotion! Peace! That every dungeon
                  May swarm with pious ministers;—forget they
                  Their old oppressions? Peace! that the grave matron
                  The Lady Fairfax may with troubled thoughts
                  Sit witness of lewd revels; mock and scorn
                  Of the light dames of the chamber, and the lordlings
                  Their gallants;—popinjays who scoff and jeer
                  At the staid solemn port, the decent coif,
                  The modest kerchief. I have heard such jeers
                  When yon gay Queen hath laughed.
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Laughed! Hath she dared!
                  Vain minion!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And to see thee with her! Thou
                  That shouldst have been a Jael in this land,
                  A Deborah, a Judith!
                  
               
               
                  Lady F.
                  Nay, we live
                  Under a milder law. Whate'er their crimes
                  Urge not this bloody trial.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Whoso saith
                  That the trial shall be bloody? He who reads
                  All hearts, He only knows how my soul yearns
                  Toward yonder pair. I seek them now, a friend,
                  With friendly proffers. As we reach thy coach
                  I'll tell thee more. Come, madam!
               
               (Exeunt.)
               
                  SCENE III.
                  —The King's Apartments
                  The King and Herbert.
                  
                     King.
                     
                        Herbert!
                  
                  
                     Her.
                     An please your Majesty.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Go seek
                     The General.
                  
                  
                     Her.
                     
                        Fairfax?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     
                        Cromwell!
                        Cromwell!
                        say
                     The King commands his presence.
                     (Exit Herbert)
                     To fore-run him,
                     To plunge at once into this stormy sea
                     Of griefs, to summon my great foe, to front
                     The obdurate Commons, the fanatic army,
                     Even the mock judges, they who dare to reign
                     Over a King, to breast them all! Then trial,
                     Or peace! Death or the crown! Rest comes with either
                     To me and England, comfortable
                              rest,
                     After my many wanderings.
                  
                  Enter the Queen
                  
                  
                     
                        Henrietta!
                     My wife, my Queen, is't thou? Is't not a dream?
                     
                        For I have dreamed so, and awakened—Heaven
                     Shield me from such a waking! Is't a truth?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Do not my tears give answer? Did that vision
                     Rain drops of joy like these?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     To see thee here
                     Is to be young and free again, again 
                     A bridegroom and a King.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Ever my King!
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I have heard nothing like that voice of hope
                     Since we were parted.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Wherefore dost thou pause?
                     Why gaze on me so mournfully?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Alas!
                     Thou art pale, my Henrietta, very pale; 
                     And this dear hand that was so round and fair
                     Is thin and wan—Oh very wan!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     'Twas pining
                     For thee that made it so. Think on the cause,
                     And thou'lt not mourn its beauty.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     And this grief,
                     Will kill her! Joined to any other man
                     She might have lived on in her loveliness
                     For half an age. She's mine, and she will die.
                     Oh this is a sad meeting! I have longed
                     Have prayed to see thee—now—Would thou wast safe
                     In France again, my dear one!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Say not so.
                     I bring thee comfort, safety. Holland, France,
                     Are firmly with thee; save the army, all
                     This rebel England
                        is thine own; and e'en
                     Amid the Army
                        some the greatest, some 
                     That call themselves thy judges. 'Tis the turn 
                     Of fate; the reflux of the tide.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Forget not
                     
                        That I am a prisoner, sweet-one; a foredoomed
                     Discrowned prisoner. As erewhile I passed
                     Sadly along, a soldier in his mood
                     Spat on me: none rebuked him; none cried shame;
                     None cleft the coward to the earth.
                     
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Oh traitors!
                     Oh sacrilegious rebels! Let my lips
                     Wipe off that scorn. My Charles, thou shalt resume
                     Thy state, shalt sit enthroned, a judge, a King,
                     Even in the solemn 
                           Hall   
                     , the lofty seat
                     Of their predestined treason. For thy life
                     It is assured—Lord
                           Broghilland a band
                     Of faithful Cavaliers—But thou shalt reign.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Dost thou remember Cromwell? Ere thou quitted'st
                     
                        England he was most like the delving worm
                     Hypocrisy; that slough is cast, and now
                     His strong and shining wings soar high in air
                     As proud ambition. First demand of him
                     What King shall reign.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     He is my trust.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Hast seen him?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     He sent me to thee now.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Ha, wherefore! But I've learned to trust in nought
                     Save Heaven. Since thou art here I am content
                     To live and reign, but all in honour. I'll 
                     Renounce no creed, resign no friend, abandon
                     No right or liberty of this abused
                     Misguided people; no nor bate one jot
                     Of the old prerogative, my
                        
                        privilege,
                     The right divine of Kings. Death were to me
                     As welcome as his pleasant evening rest
                     To the poor way-worn traveller;—And yet 
                     
                        I fain would live for thee—Cheer up, fair wife!—
                     Would live for love and thee. Hast seen thy
                           children?
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Not yet. They say Elizabeth, whose face
                     Even when a little child resembled thine,
                     To wonder, hath pined after thee, and fed
                     Her love by thinking on thee, till she hath stolen
                     Unconsciously thy mien and tone and words
                     Of patient pensiveness; a dignity
                     Of youthful sorrow, beautiful and sad.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Poor child! poor child! a woeful heritage!
                     When I have gazed on the sweet seriousness
                     Of her young beauty, I have pictured her
                     In the bright May of life, a Queenly bride,
                     Standing afore the altar with that look
                     Regal and calm, and pure as the azure skies
                     
                        Of Paradise ere tears were born. Now—
                     Enter Cromwell.
                     Cromwell!
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Did'st thou desire my presence?
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I sent for thee
                     To bear my message to thy comrades.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Sir,
                     I wait thy pleasure. I would welcome thee
                     Unto this goodly city—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Doth the gaoler
                     Welcome his prisoner? I am Charles Stuart,
                     And thou—Now shame on this rebellious blood!
                     I thought that it was disciplined and schooled
                     Into proud patience. Let me not appear
                     Discourteous—Sir, the King is bounden to thee!
                     Now hear mine errand.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Tush, hear me!
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     The Queen!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Fie! doff this strangeness, when it was thyself
                     That sent me hither! Cast aside the smooth
                     Obedient looks which hide thy thoughts. Be plain
                     And honest,Cromwell.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     I have ever been so.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Open in speech and heart, even as myself
                     When I, thy Queen, hold out the hand of peace
                     And amity, and bid thee say what title
                     The King shall give to his great General.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     None.
                     Thou bad'st me answer plainly.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet thou wast 
                     Ambitious once.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Grant that I were,—as well
                     I trust I had more grace,—but say I were so,
                     Think'st thou not there be homely names which sound
                     As sweetly in men's ears? which shall outlive
                     A thousand titles in that book of fame,
                     History? All praise be to the Lord I am not
                     Ambitious.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Chuse thine office. Keep the name
                     Thy sword hath rendered famous. Be Lord Vicar;
                     Be Captain of the Guard; forbid this suit—
                     Thou can'st an if thou wilt—be Charles's friend
                     And second man in the kingdom.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Second! Speak'st thou
                     These tempting words to me? I nor preside
                     O'er court or Parliament; I am not, Madam,
                     Lord General of the
                           Army. Seek those great ones.
                     My place is in the ranks. Would'st thou make me 
                     The second in the kingdom? Seek those great ones.
                     The second!
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Thou, and well thou know'st it, Cromwell, 
                     Art the main prop of this rebellion! General,
                     Lord President, what are they but thy tools,
                     Thy puppets, moved by thy directing will
                     As chessmen by the skilful player. 'Tis thou
                     That art the master-spirit of the time,
                     Idol of people and of army, leader
                     Of the fanatic Commons, judge, sole judge
                     Of this unrighteous cause.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     And she would make me
                     The second man of the kingdom! Thou but troublest
                     Thyself and me.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet hear me but one word.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     No more of bribes!—thou bad'st me to speak plainly:
                     Thou hast been bred in courts and deemest them
                     Omnipotent o'er all. But I eschew
                     The Mammon of unrighteousness. I warn ye
                     Ye shall learn faith in one man's honesty
                     Before ye die.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Never in thine! At Holmby
                     
                     We trusted—Fool again—'Twas not in fear;
                     I dread thee not. Thou dar'st not try the King.
                     The very word stands as a double guard,
                     A triple armour, a bright shield before him;
                     A sacred halo plays around the head
                     Anointed andendiademed, a dim
                     Mysterious glory. Who may dare to call
                     For justice on a King? Who dare to touch
                     The crowned and lofty head?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Was it at Hardwick,
                     Or Fotheringay,—fie on my dull brain—
                     That the fair Queen of Scots, the
                        popish woman,
                     The beautiful, his grandame died?Mitford's Cromwell is confused over where
                              Mary Queen of Scots was immprisoned and executed, an historical event that of course foreshadows the events of King Charles's imprisonment, trial, and regicide. His mention of "Hardwicke" seems to refer to Hardwick Hall, built by Bess of Hardwick (or Elizabeth Talbot), but the queen was never held here. Likely Mitford is referring through Cromwell to the period when Mary Queen of Scots was held captive at Sheffield Castle and Manor Lodge, guarded by George Talbot, the Sixth Earl of Shrewsbury and his wife, who was Bess of Hardwick. Bess befriended the Queen during this period of captivity.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     A Queen,
                     A vain and envious woman, yet a Queen,
                     Condemned Queen
                        Mary. Ye are subjects, rebels,
                     Ye dare not try your King; all else ye may do;
                     All else ye have done; fought, imprisoned, chased,
                     Aye, tracked and hunted, like that pious Henry,
                     The last of the red-rose, whom visiting
                     Helpless in prison, his arch enemy
                     The fiendish
                        Richard slew;—even as perchance—
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Shame on thy slanderous tongue! There lies my sword.
                     
                     Did'st take me for a murderer? Harken, Madam;
                     When thou shalt speak again of Henry's death,
                     Remember 'twas the restless shrew of Anjou
                     
                     That drove her gentle husband to his end.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Take up the sword; and, wife, I prythee peace!
                     I yet am King enough to end these brawls.
                     Take up thy sword! Albeit my breast be bare,
                     And I unarmed before him, he'll not strike.
                     That were an honest murder. There be ways
                     Stiller and darker; there be men whose craft 
                     Can doom with other tongues, with other hands
                     Can slay. I know thee, Sir.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     I would not slay
                     A sinner unprepared.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Go to! I know thee.
                     Say to the Parliament that I demand
                     A conference Lords andCommons.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Sir, the Commons
                     
                     Will grant no conference. Thou must address thee
                     To the High Court of Justice, to thy judges.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Oh vain and shallow treason! Have ye not
                     The King's High Court, the judges of the land?
                     I own no other. Yet if they—
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Expect
                     
                        Nothing of them but justice. I came to thee,
                     As to a brother, in pure charity,
                     In meek and Christian love, when these sharp taunts
                     Arose betwixt us. Still I fain would save thee.
                     Resign the crown.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Never.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Oh vanity
                     Of man's proud heart! cling to that sinful toy
                     A sound, an echo, a dim shadow, weakening
                     As the true substance flies,—cling to that word,
                     And cast away thy life!
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Hold Henrietta!
                     What! Dost thou ask me for so poor a boon
                     As life to change fair honour? I've a son,
                     A gallant princely boy—would'st have me yield
                     The old ancestral crown, his heritage,
                     For the small privilege to crawl awhile
                     On this vile earth, mated with fouler worms
                     Than they that sleep below? Would'st have me sell
                     My Kingdom for a little breath?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     Thy Kingdom!
                     Thou hast not a stronghold left.
                  
                  
                     King.
                     I have one here.
                     Thou know'st my answer.
                  
                  
                     Queen.
                     Yet if there be danger—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     Peace, dearest, peace! Is the day fixed?
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     The day,
                     The very hour, is set. At noon tomorrow,
                     Heaven permitting—
                  
                  
                     King.
                     The decrees of Heaven
                     Be oft to man's dark mind inscrutable:
                     The lightning flame hath fired the straw-thatched roof
                     Of harmless cottagers, hath rent the spire
                     Of consecrated temples, hath struck down
                     Even the dumb innocent oak that never lied
                     Never rebelled, never blasphemed. A veil
                     Hangs before Heaven's high purpose. Yet when man
                     Slays man, albeit no King, a reckoning comes
                     A deep and awful reckoning. I'll abide
                     The trial.
                  
                  
                     Crom.
                     At thy peril.
                  
                  END OF THE SECOND ACT.
               
            
         
         
            
               Act III.
            
               SCENE I.
               
                  Westminster Hall fitted up for the King's
                        trial.
               
                  Bradshaw, seated as President; Cromwell, Ireton, Harrison, Downes, Marten, Tichburne, and other Judges on benches; Cook, and other Lawyers, Clerks, &c., at a table; a chair of State for the King on one side; the Queen, veiled, and other Ladies in a Gallery behind; the whole stage filled with Guards Spectators, &c., &c.
               
                  Brad.
                  Hath every name been called? And every Judge
                  Appeared at the high summons?
               
               
                  Clerk.
                  Good my Lord,
                  Each one hath answered.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  (to Cromwell)
                  The Lord General
                  
                  Is wanting still.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The better.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  How?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fair son
                  We have enow of work—Doth not you cry 
                  Announce the prisoner?—enow of work
                  For one brief day without him.—Downes sit here
                  Beside me man.—We lack not waverers;
                  Men whose long doubts would hold from rosy dawn
                  
                     To the slow lighting of the evening star
                  In the clear Heaven of June. Of such as they
                  One were too many. How say'st thou good Downes?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Even as thou say'st.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Yet 'tis a valiant General,
                  A godly and a valiant. Ha! the prisoner!
               
               Enter the King, Herbert, and other Servants, Hacker and guards.
               (The Soldiers &c. as the King walks to his chair cry Justice! Justice!)
               
                  Crier.
                  Peace! silence in the court!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Ye shall have justice.
                  My LordsCommissioners, whilst I
                     stood pausing
                  How fitliest to disclose our mighty plea,
                  Dallying with phrase and form, yon eager cry
                  Shot like an arrow to the mark, laying bare
                  The very core of our intent. Sirs, we
                  Are met to render justice, met to judge
                  In such a cause as scarce the lucent sun
                  That smiles upon us from his throne hath seen
                  Since light was born. We sit to judge a King
                  Arraigned by his own people; to make inquest
                  Into the innocent blood which hath been spilled
                  Like water; into crime and tyranny,
                  Treason and murder. Look that we be pure
                  My brethren! that we cast from out our hearts
                  All blinding passions: Fear that blinks and trembles
                  At shadows ere they come; Pride that walks dazzled
                  In the light of her vainglory; feeble Pity
                  Whose sight is quenched in tears; and grim Revenge
                  Her fierce eyes sealed with gore. Look that we chase
                  
                     Each frail affection, each fond hidden sin, 
                  Each meaner virtue from our hearts, and cling
                  To Justice, only Justice. Now for thee
                  
                     Charles Stuart King
                     of England: Thou art here
                  To render compt of awful crimes, of treason
                  Conspiracy and murder. Answer!
               
               
                  Cook.
                  First
                  May it please you hear the charge?
               
               
                  King.
                  Stop! Who are ye
                  That dare to question me?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Thy Judges.
               
               
                  King.
                  Say
                  My subjects. I am a King whom none may judge 
                  On earth. Who sent ye here?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The Commons.
               
               
                  King.
                  What!
                  Be there no traitors, no conspirators
                  No murderers save Kings, that they dare call
                  Stern justice down from Heaven? Sir I fling back
                  The charge upon their heads, the guilt, the shame,
                  The eternal infamy,—on them who sowed
                  The tares of hate in fields of love; who armed
                  Brother 'gainst brother, breaking the sweet peace
                  Of country innocence, the holy ties
                  Of nature breaking, making war accurst
                  As that Egyptian plague the worst and last
                  When the First-born were slain. I have no answer
                  References the plagues in the Old Testament Book of Exodus, chapters 11-12, brought upon the Eqyptians to convince the Pharoah to release the Israelites from slavery. In the final plague, the Egyptians' first-born sons are killed by divine vengeance while the homes of the Israelites are passed over and their sons escape.
                  For them or ye. I know ye not.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Be warned;
                  Plead to the accusation.
               
               
                  King.
                  I will die
                  A thousand deaths, rather than by my breath
                  Give life to this new court against the laws
                  And liberties of England.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Sir we know 
                  Your love of liberty andEngland. Call
                  The witnesses. Be they in court?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  They wait
                  Without.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Send for them quickly. Once again
                  King wilt thou plead?
               
               
                  King.
                  Thou hast my answer, never.
               
               (A pause of a few moments during which the head of the King's
                        staff on which he was leaning falls and rolls across the stage.)
               
                  Mar.
                  (to Ireton)
                  What fell? The breathless silence of this vast
                  And crowded court gives to each common sound
                  A startling clearness. What hath fallen?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The head
                  Of the King's staff. See how it spins and bounds
                  Along the floor, as hurrying to forsake
                  The royal wretch its master. Now it stops
                  At Cromwell's
                     feet—direct at Cromwell's feet.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The toy is broken.
               
               
                  Har.
                  What is the device?
                  Some vain Idolatrous image?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No, a crown;
                  A gilded crown, a hollow glittering crown,
                  Shaped by some quaint and cunning goldsmith. Look
                  On what a reed he leans, who props himself
                  On such a bauble.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  It rolled straight to thee;—
                  If thou wast superstitious—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Pass the toy
                  On to the prisoner! he hath faith in omens—
                  I—fling him back his gewgaw!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Master Cook
                  
                  We wait too long.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  My Lord the witnesses—
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Call any man. Within our bleeding land
                  There lives not one so blest in ignorance
                  As not to know this treason. None so high
                  But the storm overtopped him; none so low
                  But the wind stooped to root him up. Call any man
                  The Judge upon the bench, the Halberdier
                  That guards the door.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  
                     Oliver
                     Cromwell!
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  No need to swear him. He hath ta'en already 
                  The Judges' oath.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The Judges' oath, not this. 
                  Omit no form of guardian law, remember
                  The life of man hangs on our lips.
               
               
                  King.
                  Smooth traitor!
               
               (Cromwell is
                        sworn.)
               
                  Cook.
                  Lieutenant General Cromwell, wast thou present
                  In the great fight of Naseby?
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Was I present!
                  Why I think ye know that. I was.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Didst see
                  The prisoner in the battle?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Many times.
                  He led his army,
                     in a better cause
                  I should have said right gallantly. I saw him
                  First in the onset, last in the retreat.
                  That justice let me pay the King.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Raised he
                  His banner 'gainst his people? Didst thou see
                  
                     The royal standard in the field?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  My Lord
                  It rose full in the centre of their host
                  Floating upon the heavy air.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  The arms 
                  Of England?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, the very lion shield
                  That waved at 
                        
                           Cressi
                           Crécy
                        
                     and at 
                        
                           Azincourt
                           Agincourt
                        
                     
                  
                  Triumphant. None may better know than I,
                  For it so pleased the Ruler of the Field,
                  The Almighty King of Battles, that my arm
                  Struck down the standard-bearer and restored
                  The English lion to
                     the lion hearts
                  Of England.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Please you, Sir, retire. Now summon—
               
               
                  King.
                  Call not another. What I have done boldly,
                  In the face of day and of the nation, that,
                  Nothing repenting, nothing derogating
                  From the King's high perogative,as boldly
                  As freely I avow—to you—to all men.
                  I own ye not as Judges. Ye have power
                  As pirates or land robbers o'er the wretch
                  Entrapped within their den, a power to mock
                  Your victim with a form of trial, to dress
                  Plain murder in a mask of law. As Judges
                  I know ye not.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Enough that you confess 
                  The treason—
               
               
                  King.
                  Stop! Sir, I appeal to them
                  Whence you derive your power.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The people? King
                  Thou seest them here in us.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh that my voice
                  Could reach my loyal people! That the winds
                  
                     Could waft the echoes of this groined roof
                  So that each corner of the land might hear,
                  From the fair Southern vallies to
                     the hills
                  Of my own native North, from the
                           bleak shores
                  Of the great ocean to the channeled West,
                  Their rightful Monarch's cry. Then should ye hear
                  From the universal nation, town and plain,
                  Forest and village, the stern awful shout
                  Of just deliverance, mighty and prolonged,
                  Deafening the earth and piercing Heaven, and smiting
                  Each guilty conscience with such fear as waits 
                  On the great Judgment-Day. The wish is vain—
                  Ah! vainer than a dream! I and my people
                  Are over-mastered. Yet, Sir, I demand
                  A conference with these masters. Tell the Commons
                  
                  The King would speak with them.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  We have no power
                  To stay the trial.
                  
                  
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Nay, good my Lord, perchance
                  The King would yield such reason as might move
                  The Commons to renew the treaty. Best
                  Confer with them.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (to Downes)
                  Art mad?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  'Tis ye are mad
                  That urge with a remorseless haste this work 
                  Of savage butchery onward. I was mad
                  That joined ye.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  This is sudden.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  He's our King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Our King! Have we not faced him in the field
                  A thousand times? Our King! Downes, hath the
                     Lord
                  Forsaken thee? Why I have seen thyself
                  Hewing through mailed battalia, till thy sword
                  And thy good arm were dyed in gore, to reach
                  
                     Yon man. Didst mean to save him? Listen, Sir,
                  I am thy friend. 'Tis said,—I lend no ear
                  To slanderers, but this tale was forced upon me—
                  'Tis said that one whose grave and honoured name
                  Sorts ill with midnight treachery, was seen
                  Stealing from the Queen's lodging!—I'm thy friend, 
                  Thy fast friend! We oft see in this bad world
                  The shadow Envy crawling stealthily
                  Behind fair Virtue;—I hold all for false
                  Unless thou prove it true;—I am thy friend!—
                  But if the sequestrators heard this tale—
                  Thou hast broad lands.
                        (Aloud)
                     Why do ye pause?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  My high
                  And honouring task to plead at this great bar
                  For lawful liberty, for suffering conscience,
                  For the old guardians of our rights the Commons,
                  Against the lawless fiend Prerogative,
                  The persecuting Church, the tyrant King,
                  Were needless now and vain. The haughty prisoner
                  Denies your jurisdiction. I call on ye
                  For instant judgment.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Sir, for the last time
                  I ask thee, wilt thou plead? 
               
               
                  King.
                  Have I not answered? 
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Your judgment, good my Lords!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  All ye who deem
                  
                     Charles Stuart
                     guilty, rise!
               
               (The Judges all stand up.)
               
                  King.
                  What all!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Not one
                  Is wanting. Clerk, record him guilty.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  Now
                  The sentence!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     (from the Gallery)
                  Traitors, hold!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (To Ireton)
                  Heard'st thou a scream?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  'Tis the malignant wife of
                        Fairfax.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No!
                  A greater far than she.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Hold, murderers!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (aloud)
                  Lead
                  Yon railing woman from her seat. My Lord,
                  Please you proceed.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  (rushing to the King)
                  Traitors, here is my seat—
                  I am the Queen;—here is my place, my state,
                  My Lord and Sovereign,—here at thy feet.
                  I claim it with a prouder humbler heart,
                  A lowlier duty, a more loyal love,
                  Than when the false and glittering diadem
                  Encircled first my brow, a queenly bride.
                  Put me not from thee! scorn me not! I am
                  Thy wife.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh true and faithful wife! Yet leave me,
                  Lest the strong armour of my soul, her patience,
                  Be melted by thy tears. Oh go! go! go!
                  This is no place for thee.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Why thou art here!
                  Who shall divide us?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Force her from him, Guards;
                  Remove her.
               
               
                  King.
                  Tremble ye who come so near
                  As but to touch her garments. Cowards! Slaves!
                  Though the King's power be gone, yet the man's
                     strength
                  Remains unwithered. She's my wife; my all.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  None thinks to harm the Lady. Good my Lord,
                  The hour wears fast with these slight toys.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     I come
                  To aid ye not impede. If in this land
                  To wear the lineal crown, maintain the laws,
                  Uphold the insulted Church, be crimes, then I
                  Am guilty, guiltier than your King. 'Twas I
                  That urged the war—ye know he loved me;—I
                  That prompted his bold councils; edged and whetted
                  His great resolves; spurred his high courage on
                  Against ye, rebels! I that armed my knight
                  And sent him forth to battle. Mine the crime;—
                  Be mine the punishment! Deliver him,
                  And lead me to the block. Pause ye? My blood
                  Is royal too. Within my veins the rich
                  Commingled stream of princely Medici
                  
                  And regal Bourbon flows: 'Twill mount as high, 
                  Twill stain your axe as red, t'will feed as full 
                  Your hate of Kings.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Madam, we wage no war
                  On women.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  I have warred on ye, and now—
                  Take heed how ye release me!He is gentle
                  Patient and kind; he can forgive. But I
                  Shall roam a frantic widow through the world,
                  Counting each day for lost that hath not gained
                  An enemy to England, a revenger
                  Of this foul murder.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Woman, peace! The sentence!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Yoursentence, bloody judges! As ye deal
                  With your anointed King the red right arm
                  Of Heaven shall avenge him: here on earth
                  By clinging fear and black remorse, and death
                  Unnatural ghastly death, and then the fire,
                  The eternal fire, where panting murderers gasp
                  
                     And cannot die, that deepest Hell which holds
                  The Regicide.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Peace! I have overlong
                  Forgotten my great office. Hence! or force
                  Shall rid us of thy frenzy. Know'st thou not
                  That curses light upon the curser's head,
                  As surely as the cloud which the sun drains
                  From the salt sea returns into the wave
                  In stormy gusts or plashing showers? Remove her.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Oh mercy! mercy! I'll not curse; I'll be
                  As gentle as a babe. Ye cannot doom him
                  Whilst I stand by. Even the hard headsman veils
                  His victim's eyes before he strikes, afeared
                  Lest his heart fail. And could ye, being men
                  Not fiends, abide a wife's keen agony
                  Whilst—I'll not leave thee Charles! I'll never leave thee
               
               
                  King.
                  This is the love stronger than life, the love
                  Of woman. Henrietta, listen. Loose
                  Thy arms from round my neck; here is no axe;
                  This is no scaffold. We shall meet anon
                  Untouched, unharmed; I shall return to thee
                  Safe, safe,—shall bide with thee. Listen my dear
                           one,
                  Thy husband prays, thy King commands thee, Go!
                  Go! Lead her gently, very gently.
                  (Exit the Queen, led.)
                  Now
                  I am ready. Speak your doom, and quickly.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Death.
                  Thou art adjudged to die. Sirs, do ye all
                  Accord in this just sentence?
               
               The Judges all stand up.
               
                  King.
                  I am ready.
                  To a grey head, aching with royal cares,
                  The block is a kind pillow. Yet once more—
               
               
                  Brad.
                  
                     Silence. The Sentence is pronounced; the time
                  Is past. Conduct him from the Court.
               
               
                  King.
                  Not hear me!
                  Me your anointed King! Look ye what justice
                  A meaner man may hope for.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why refuse
                  His death-speech to a prisoner? Whoso knoweth
                  What weight hangs on his soul. Speak on and fear not.
               
               
                  King.
                  Fear! Let the guilty fear. Feel if my pulse
                  Flutter? Look if my cheek be faded? Harken
                  If my calm breathing be not regular,
                  Even as an infant's who hath dropt asleep
                  Upon its mother's breast? As I lift up
                  This Sword, miscalled of Justice, my clear voice
                  Hoarsens nor falters not. See, I can smile
                  As thinking on the axe, I draw the bright
                  
                     Keen edge across my hand. Fear! Would ye ask
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                  
                  What weight is on my soul, I tell ye none 
                  Save that I yielded once to your
                     decree, 
                  And slew my Faithfullest. Oh
                        Strafford!
                     Strafford!
                  
                  This is a retribution!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Better weep 
                  Thy sins than one just holy act.
               
               
                  King.
                  For ye 
                  My subject-judges I couldweep; for thee 
                  Beloved and lovely country. Thou wilt groan 
                  Under the tyrant Many till some bold
                  And crafty soldier, one who in the field
                  Is brave as the roused lion, at the Council
                  Watchful and gentle as the couchant pard,
                  The lovely spotted pard, what time she stoops
                  To spring upon her prey; one who puts on,
                  
                     To win each several soul, his several sin,
                  A stern fanatic, a smooth hypocrite,
                  A fierce rebublican, a coarse buffoon,
                  Always a great bad
                        man; till he shall come,
                  And climb the vacant throne, and fix
                     him there,
                  A more than King. Cromwell, if such thou know'st
                  Tell him the rack would prove an easier couch
                  Than he shall find that throne; tell him the crown
                  On an Usurper's brow will scorch and burn,
                  As though the diamonded and ermined round
                  Were framed of glowing steel.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hath His dread wrath
                  Smitten thee with frenzy?
               
               
                  King.
                  Tell him, for thou know'st him,
                  That Doubt and Discord like fell harpies wait
                  Around the Usurper's board. By night, by day, 
                  Beneath the palace roof, beneath that roof
                  More fair, the summer sky, fear shall appal
                  And danger threaten, and all natural loves
                  Wither and die; till on his dying bed, 
                  Old fore his time, the wretched traitor lies
                  Heartbroken. Then, for well thou know'st him,
                     Cromwell,
                  Bid him to think on me, and how I  fell 
                  Hewn in my strength and prime, like a proud oak,
                  The tallest of the forest, that but shivers 
                  His glorious top and dies. Oh! thou shalt envy, 
                  In thy long agony, my fall, that shakes 
                  A kingdom but not me. 
                  
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  
               
               
                  Soldiers.
                  
               
               
                  Crom.
                  
                  
                  
                  
               
               
                  Soldiers.
                  
                  
               
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He is possessed!—
                  My good Lord President, the day wears on—
                  Possessed of a fierce Devil!
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Lead him forth.
               
               
                  King.
                  Why so. Ye are warned.
                  On to my prison, Sirs!
                  On to my prison!
               
               (Soldiers &c. cry "On to Execution!" "Justice and
                        Execution!"
               
                  Crom.
                  Nay, my comrades,
                  Vex not a sinner's parting hour. The wrath
                  Is on him, Harrison!

                  SCENE I.
               An Apartment in Cromwell's House.
               
                  Cromwell alone.
               
                  Crom.
                  So, my lord Broghill! We are shrewdly rid
                  Of one bold plotter. Now to strike at once,
                  Ere fresh conspiracies—
               
               Enter Ireton.
               
                  Cromwell.
                  What mak'st thou here,
                  Fair son?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Sir,
                  The Lords Commissioners refuse 
                  To sign the warrant. He'll escape us yet.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Refuse! What all?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  No; HarrisonandBradshaw still hold firm.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Too few! too few!
                  Aye, he'll escape. They'll treat. What say the traitors?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The most keep stubborn silence. Harrison
                  
                  Is hoarse with railing.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Overhot! But that's
                  A fault may pass for virtue. Overcold's, 
                  Your modish sin. Weakness or treachery!
                  
                     Peters or Judases! They'll treat. They'll treat.
                  
                     Where lies thy regiment?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  At Westminster.
                  One glance of their bright swords, one stirring note
                  Of their war-trumpet, and these dastard Judges—
                  I'll seek them instantly.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Son, thou mistak'st. 
                  Foul shame it were here in a Christian land 
                  To govern by brute force—How many hast thou? 
               
               
                  Ire.
                  A thousand horse.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Or turn their very guards
                  Against the Judges—Be they trusty?
                  
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Sir,
                  I'll answer for them as myself.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Nay, go not.
                  No force, good Son! No force! 
                  Enter a Servant.
                  What wouldst thou? Speak.
               
               
                  Servant.
                  The Colonel Harrison
                     sends me to crave 
                  Your Excellency's presence.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye! I come. 
                  Didst meet thy fellow Robert, and the gallant 
                  Whom thou saw'st here this morning?
               
               
                  Serv.
                  Sir, they passed me 
                  At speed.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I come. No force, good son. Remember 
                  This is a Christian land. We must keep pure
                  The Judgment seat. No force.
                  (Exit Ireton.)
                  At speed! Ere now
                  They have crost the Thames at
                        Kew. We are quit of one
                  Bold Cavalier. What said the Colonel?
               
               
                  Serv.
                  Prayed
                  Your instant presence, and betwixt his teeth
                  Muttered "Faint craven souls!"
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fie! Fie! to speak 
                  Irreverently of such great-ones. Faint 
                  And craven souls! Follow my son;thou'lt find him
                  Heading his valiant horse. Bid him be still
                  Till I send to him—still as night. And now
                  For ye wise Judges!
               
               
                  (Exeunt.)
               
               
            
            
               SCENE II.
               The Painted Chamber.
               
               
                  Bradshaw, Harrison, Cook, Downes, Tichburne, Marten, and other Judges.
               
                  Har.
                  Be ye all smit with palsy? Hang your arms
                  Dead at your sides, that ye refuse to sign
                  The Warrant? Be ye turned Idolaters?
                  Rank worshippers of Baal?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  They refuse not.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  They parley, Sir, they dally, they delay.
               
               
                  Cook.
                  The wiser if they did. 'Twere vantage ground,
                  The keen axe swinging o'er his head, to treat
                  With yon great prisoner.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Treat! Was yonder trial
                  
                  A mummery, a stage-play, a farce? Oh blind
                  And stubborn generation!
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The whole people
                  Are struck with awe and pity. Each man's cheek
                  Is pale; each woman's eye is wet; each child
                  Lifts up its little hands as to implore
                  Mercy for the poor King.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Captivity
                  And bondage will o'ertake them! They fall off
                  Like the revolted Tribes. Ægyptian bondage!
               
               (Enter Cromwell.)
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore so loud good Colonel? Sirs, I shame
                  To have held ye waiting here.A sudden cause,
                  I pray ye believe it urgent, hindered me.
                  Where is the warrant? Have ye left a space
                  For my poor name?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Thou wilt find room enow.
                  There!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  What unsigned?—Harrison!—He came hither 
                  To crave your signatures.
               
               
                  Har.
                  I did my message!
                  But these Philistines—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Do ye shame to set 
                  Your names to your own deeds? Did ye not pass
                  This solemn sentence in the face of day,
                  Before the arraigned King, the shouting people,
                  The majesty of Heaven?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Thou dost mistake us.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I crave your pardon, Sirs. I deemed ye were
                  The judges, the King's judges, the elect 
                  Of England, chosen by her godly Commons
                  
                  As wisest, boldest, best. I did mistake ye.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Listen, ere thou accuse us.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Listen! sign!
                  And we will listen though your pleaded reason
                  Outlast Hugh Peter's sermon.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Hear me first.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Well.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  We have here Commissioners from Scotland
                  
                  Praying our mercy on the King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  They gave him
                  Into our hands.
               
               
                  Har.
                  And they are answered Sir.
                  Thou know'st that Cromwell singly put
                     them down,
                  As they had been young babes.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The Pensionary—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Pshaw!
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Hath sent pressing missives; Embassies
                  From every court, are on the seas; andCharles
                  
                  Proffers great terms.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Have we not all?
               
               
                  Cook.
                  But he
                  Will give a fair security, a large
                  And general amnesty. So are we freed
                  From fear of after-reckoning.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Master Cook
                  
                  No wonder that a lawyer pleads to-day
                  Against his cause of yesterday—if fee'd 
                  To the height. But thou art not of us; thy part
                  Is o'er
               
               
                  Mar.
                  He will give large securities!
                  For what?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  The general safetyandour own.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Safety, say liberty! Securities.
                  Many large promises! An ye will trust
                  Ye may be Earls and Marquesses, and portion
                  This pretty islet England as a manor
                  Amongst ye. Shame ye not to think a bribe
                  Might win your souls from freedom?
               
               
                  Har.
                  From the Lord!
                  Would ye desert His people? sell for gain
                  His cause?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Hush! Hush! None thinketh to forsake
                  The cause!
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Let Bradshaw sign. What need more names
                  Than the Lord President's?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  I am ready, Sirs,
                  An ye will follow me. The Instrument
                  Were else illegal. When ye are prepared,
                  Speak.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  My good masters, ye remember me
                  Of a passage of my boyhood.
                  (then aside to Bradshaw and Harrison
                  
                  
                  Deem me not
                  A light unmeaning trifler, recollect
                  How Nathan spake to David.(then aloud) Being a child
                  Nutting with other imps in the old copse
                  At Hinchinbroke, we saw across a wide
                  But shallow stream one overhanging hazel.
                  Whose lissome stalks were weighed by the rich fruitage
                  Almost into the water. As we stood
                  Eyeing the tempting boughs, a shining nut
                  Fell from its socket, dimpling wide around
                  The dark clear mirror. At that sight one bold
                  And hardy urchin, with myself, no less
                  In those young days a daring wight, at once
                  Plunged in the sparkling rivulet. It rose
                  Above our ancles, to our knees, half up
                  Our thighs, and my scared comrade in the midst
                  Of the stream turned roaring back, and gained the bank
                  Nutless and wet, amidst the scoffing shouts
                  Of the small people.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Why I bore
                  My course right on , and gained the spoil. Sirs, we
                  Have plunged kneedeep in the waters; are midway
                  The stream: Will ye turn now and leave the fruit
                  Ungathered, recreants? or hold boldly on
                  And win the holy prize of freedom? Give me
                  The warrant.
                  (signs.)So! methinks an it were not
                  Over ambitious, and that's a sin;
                  My homely name should stand alone to this
                  Most righteous scroll. Follow who list. I've left
                  A space for the Lord President.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  I'll fill it 
                  With an unworthy name.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Now, swell the roll!
                  My masters! Whither goest thou Marten? None
                  Shall stir till he hath signed. Thou a ripe scholar,
                  Not write thy name! I can write mine i' the dark,
                  And oft with my sword-point have traced in air
                  The viewless characters in the long hour
                  Before the joy of battle. Shut thine eyes,
                  And write thy name! Anywhere! See
                  (Marking Marten's cheek
                     with a pen.) 
                  NayMarten,
                  Stand still!—See! See! how fair and clerkly! Yet 
                  This parchment is the smoother.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Hold thee sure
                  I'll pay thee, General.
               
               
                  Bradshaw.
                  Why he hath marked thee
                  Like a new ruddled sheep.
               
               
                  Mar.
                  I'll pay thee.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sign.
               
               
                  Marten.
                  Willingly; joyfully.
               
               (signs.)
               
                  Crom.
                  Why so. Where goes
                  Our zealous alderman? I deemed to see
                  His name the first.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  He fears the City's safety,
                  Full, as he says, of the King's friends.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He fears!
                  They be bold men who fearlessly do own
                  Their fears. I dare not. Fear! Sir, didst thou come
                  By water hither?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  No.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  And didst thou meet
                  No soldiers on thy way?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  Many. The streets
                  Are swarming with them.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Were they silent?
               
               
                  Tich.
                  No.
                  They called aloud for execution.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Say,
                  For justice and for execution. Marry,
                  My Ironsides know not the new state trick
                  To separate the words. Well! are not they
                  A nearer fear? Sign boldly.

                  'Tis time, for plots are weaving round about us,
                  Like spider's nets in Autumn. But this morning
                  I swept one web away. Lord Broghill—
               
               
                  Mar.
                  What!
                  Hath he been here?
               
               
                  Dow.
                  Is he discovered?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,
                  I have a slow-hound's scent to track a traitor.
                  He's found and he's despatched.
               
               
                  Dow.
                  How?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Where?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  To Ireland,
                  With a commission 'gainst the rebels. 'Tis
                  An honest soldier who deserves to fight
                  For the good cause. He but mistook his side;
                  The Queen beguiled him, and the knightly sound
                  Of lloyalty. But 'tis an honest soldier.
                  He will prove faithful.

                  How didst win him?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  How?
                  A word of praise, a thought of fear. How do men
                  Win traitors? Hark yeDownes! Lord Broghill left
                  A list of the King's friends amongst us here;—

                  What was the plan?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Go sign I say.—The plan!
                  A sudden rescue, to o'erpower the guard.—

                  Thy wicked kinsman held thy hand.—Aye,now

                  Ye

                  In earnest thanks  for quick deliverance
                  From sudden danger. Ye knew nought of this
                  Great jeopardy, nor need ye know. Give thanks,
                  And question not. Ye are safe.

                  Did ye not hear me even now take order
                  The guard should be dispersed? Question no more.
                  Ye are so safe, that this slight parchment, Sirs,

               SCENE III.
               The —The King's Apartments.
               Enter the King leading in the Princess Elizabethand the Duke of Gloucester.
               
                  King.
                  Here we may weep at leisure. Yon fierce ruffian
                  Will scarce pursue us here. Elizabeth,
                  I thought I had done with anger, but the soldier
                  Who gazed on thee awhile, with looks that seemed
                  To wither thy young beauty, and with words—
                  My child! my child! And I had not the power
                  To shield mine own sweet child!
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  I saw him not;
                  I heard him not: I could see none but thee;
                  Could hear no voice but thine.
               
               
                  King.
                  When I am gone
                  Who shall protect thee?
               
               
                  Glou.
                  I shall soon be tall;
                  And then—
               
               
                  King.
                  Poor boy! Elizabeth, be thou 
                  A mother to him. Rear him up in peace
                  And humbleness. Show him how sweet Content
                  Can smile on dungeon floors; how the mewed lark
                  Sings in his narrow cage. Plant patience, dearones,
                  Deep in your hearts.
                  Enter Herbert.
                  
                     Herbert, where stays the Queen?
                  Still on that hopeless quest of hope, though friends
                  Drop from her fast as leaves in Autumn?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Sire,
                  Her Grace is absent still. But General Cromwell
                  
                  Craves audience of your Majesty.
               
               
                  King.
                  Admit him.
                  Wipe off those tears,Elizabeth. Resume
                  Thy gentle courage. Thou art a Princess.
                  Enter Cromwell.
                  
                  Sir,
                  Thou seest me with my children. Doth thine errand
                  Demand their absence?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. I sent them to thee
                  In Christian charity. Thou hast not fallen
                  Amongst the Heathen.
               
               
                  King.
                  Howsoever sent,
                  It was a royal boon. My heart hath ached
                  With the vain agony of longing love
                  To look upon those blooming cheeks, to kiss
                  Those red and innocent lips, to hear the sound
                  Of those dear voices.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir, 'twas meet they came
                  That thou might'st see them once again, might'st say—
               
               
                  King.
                  Farewell!—I can endure the word—a last
                  Farewell! I have dwelt so long upon the thought,
                  The sound seems nothing. Ye have signed
                        the sentence?
                  Fear not to speak Sir.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis a grievous duty—
               
               
                  King.
                  Ye havesigned. And the day?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Tomorrow.
               
               
                  King.
                  What!
                  So soon? And yet I thank  
                        ye. Speed is mercy. 
                  Ye must away, poor children.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Nay, the children
                  May bide with thee till nightfall.
               
               
                  King.
                  Take them ,Herbert!
                  
                  Take them.
               
               
                  Children.
                  Oh! no, no, no!
               
               
                  King.
                  Dear-ones, I go 
                  On a great journey. Bless ye once again,
                  My children! We must part. Farewell.
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  Oh father,
                  Let me go with thee!
               
               
                  King.
                  Know'st thou whither?
               
               
                  Eliz.
                  Yes;
                  To Heaven. Oh take me with thee! I must die;
                  When the tree falls, the young buds wither. Take me
                  Along with thee to Heaven! Let us lie
                  Both in one grave!
               
               
                  King.
                  Now bless ye! This is death;
                  This is the bitterness of love.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Fair child
                  Be comforted.
               
               
                  King.
                  Did'st thou not pat her head?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  She minded me, all in her innocent tears,
                  Of one in mine own dwelling.
               
               
                  King.
                  Thou hast daughters;
                  Be kind to her.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I will.
               
               
                  King.
                  And the poor boy—
                  He comes not near the throne. Make not of him 
                  A puppet King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I think not of it.
               
               
                  King.
                  Take them,
                  Good Herbert! And
                     my wife—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  She shall be safe;
                   shall home to France unharmed.
               
               
                  King.
                  Now fare ye well!—
                  
                     Cromwell come back!—No, bring them not again—
                  No more of parting—bbless them! bless them! See 
                  The girl, the poor poor girl, hath wept away 
                  Her tears, and pants and shivers like a fawn
                  Dying. Oh! for some gentle face to look on
                  When she revives, or she will surely die.
               
               Exeunt Herbertand the Children.
               
                  Crom.
                  She shall be cared for.
               
               
                  King.
                  Are they gone? quite gone?
                  I might have kissed them once again, have charged them
                  To love each other.—No, 'tis best.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thou bad'st me
                  Remain. What is thy will?
               
               
                  King.
                  Be kind to them,
                  Be very kind to them!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Have I not promised?
                  Was that what thou would'st say?
               
               
                  King.
                  No. But the love, 
                  The o'ermastering love—that was the death-pang. Cromwell,
                  Thou wilt be kind to them?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Would'st have me swear?
               
               
                  King.
                  Nay, swear not, lest I doubt. I will believe thee.
                  And for the human pity thou hast shown,
                  The touch of natural ruth, I pray thee take 
                  My thanks.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I would have saved thee. By this hand,
                  This sinful hand, I would have saved thee, King,
                  Had'st thou flung by yon bauble.
               
               
                  King.
                  There is One
                  Who reads all hearts, one who pursues all crimes,
                  From silver-tongued and bland hypocrisy 
                  To treasonous murder. The unspoken thought,
                  And the loud lie, and the accursed act,
                  Mount to His throne together. Tempt Him not.
                  I know thee for the worker of this deed,
                  And knowing pardon thee:—but tempt not Him!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thy blood be on thy head! I would have saved thee—
                  Even now the thought stirred in me. Pardon, Lord,
                  That gazing on the father's agonies,
                  My heart of flesh waxed faint, and I forgot
                  Thy glory andThy cause, the suffering saints.
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  The tyrant's tyranny, and Thy great word,
                  Freedom! Thy blood be on thy head.
               
               
                  King.
                  So be it.
               
               End of the Fourth Act.
            
         
         
            ACT V.
            
               SCENE I.
                The King's Bedchamber.
                >(On account of the length of the Tragedy, this scene is
                        omitted in representation.)
               
               
               The King, starting from his couch;Herbert asleep.
               
                  King.
                  
                     Herbert! Is't time
                     to rise? He sleeps. What sounds
                  Were those that roused me? Hark again! The clang
                  Of hammers! Yet the watch-light burns; the day
                  Is still unborn. This is a work of night,
                  Of deep funereal darkness. Each loud stroke
                  Rings like a knell, distinct, discordant, shrill,
                  Gathering, redoubling, echoing round my head,
                  Smiting me only with its sound amid
                  The slumbering city, tolling in mine ear—
                  A passing bell! It is the scaffold. Heaven
                  Grant me to tread it with as calm a heart
                  As I bear now. His sleep is troubled.Herbert!
                  
                  'Twere best to wake him. Herbert! rouse thee, man!
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Did your Grace call?
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye; we should be today
                  Early astir. I've a great business toward,
                  To exchange the kingly wreath, my crown of thorns,
                  For an eternal diadem; to die— 
                  And I would go trim as a bridegroom. Give me
                  Yon ermined cloak. If the crisp nipping frost
                  Should cause me shiver, there be tongues would call
                  The wintery chillness Fear. Herbert, my sleep
                  Hath been as soft and balmy, as young babes
                  Inherit from their blessed innocence,
                  Or hardy peasants win with honest toil.
                  When I awoke thy slumbers were perturbed,
                  Unquiet.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Vexed, my liege, with dreams.
               
               
                  King.
                  Of what?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  So please you, Sire, demand not.
               
               
                  King.
                  Dost thou think
                  A dream can vex me now? Speak.
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Thrice I slept,
                  And thrice I woke,and thrice the self-same vision
                  Haunted my fancy. Seemed this very room,
                  This dim and waning taper, this dark couch,
                  Beneath whose crimson canopy reclined
                  A form august and stately. The pale ray
                  Of the watch-light dwelt upon his face, and showed
                  His paler lineaments, where majesty 
                  And manly beauty,and deep trenching thought,
                  And Care the wrinkler, all were blended now
                  Into one calm and holy pensiveness,
                  Softened by slumber. I stood gazing on him
                  With weeping love, as one awake; when sudden
                  A thick and palpable darkness fell around,
                  A blindness, and dull groans and piercing shrieks
                  A moment echoed; then they ceased, and light 
                  Burst forth and musick—light such as the flood
                  Of day-spring at the dawning, rosy, sparkling,
                  An insupportable brightness—and i'th' midst,
                  Over the couch, a milk-white dove, which soared 
                  Right upward, cleaving with its train of light
                  The Heavens like a star. The couch remained
                  Vacant.
               
               
                  King.
                  Oh that the spirit so may pass!
                  So rise! Thrice did'st thou say?
               
               
                  Herb.
                  Three times the vision
                  Passed o'er my fancy.
               
               
                  King.
                  A thrice-blessed omen! 
                  
                  
                  
                     Herbert, my soul is full of serious joy,
                  Content and peaceful as the Autumn sun,
                  When, smiling for awhile on the ripe sheaves
                  And kissing the brown woods, he bids the world
                  A calm goodnight. Bear witness that I die
                  In charity with all men; and take thou, 
                  My kind and faithful servant, follower
                  Of my evil fortunes, true and tender, take 
                  All that thy master hath to give—his thanks,
                  His poor but honest thanks. Another King
                  Shall better pay thee. Weep not. Seek the
                        Bishop;
                  And if thou meet with that fair constancy, 
                  My mournful Henrietta, strive to turn
                  Her steps away till—I'm a coward yet,
                  And fear her, lest she come to plunge my thoughts
                  In the deep fountain of her sad fond tears,
                  To win me—Ha! can that impatient foot,
                  That hurrying hand, which shakes the door—
               
               Enter the Queen.
               
                  Queen.
                  My Charles!
               
               
                  King.
                  Haste to the Bishop.
               
               Exit Herbert.
               
                  Queen.
                  Charles!
               
               
                  King.
                  Already here!
                  Thou did'st fall trembling in my arms, last night,
                  Dizzy and faint and spent, as the tired martlet,
                  Midway her voyage, drops panting on the deck,
                  And slumbers through the tempest. I kissed off
                  The tears that hung on those fair eyelids, blessing
                  Thy speechless weariness, thy weeping love
                  That sobbed itself to rest. Never did mother
                  Watching her fevered infant pray for sleep 
                  So calm, so deep, so long, as I besought 
                  Of Heaven for thee when half unconscious, yet
                  Moaning and plaining like a dove, they bore thee
                  With gentle force away. And thou art here
                  Already! wakened into sense and life 
                  And the day's agony.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Here! I have been
                  To Harrison, to
                        Marten, to Lord
                        Fairfax, 
                  To Downes, to Ireton,— even at Bradshaw's feet
                  I've knelt to day. Sleep now? shall I e'er sleep 
                  Again!
               
               
                  King.
                  At Bradshaw's feet! Oh perfect love
                  How can I chide thee? Yet I would thou had'st spared
                  Thyself and me that scorn.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Do Hunters scorn
                  The shrill cries of the lioness, whose cubs
                  They've snared, although the Forest-Queen approach
                  Crouching? Do seamen scorn the forked lightning
                  Albeit the storm-cloud weep? They strove to soothe; 
                  They spake of pity; one of hope.
               
               
                  King.
                  Alas!
                  All thy life long the torturer hope hath been
                  Thy master!—Yet if she can steal an hour
                  From grief—whom dost thou trust?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Thyself and Heaven 
                  And a relenting woman. Wrap thyself
                  Close in my cloak—Here! here!—to Lady Fairfax!
                  She's faithful; she'll conceal thee. Take the cloak;
                  Waste not a point of time, not whilst the grain of sand 
                  Runs in the glass. Dost fear its shortness? See
                  How long it is! 
                  
                  
                  
                  On with the cloak. Begone!
               
               
                  King.
                  And thou?
               
               
                  Queen.
                  My post is here.
               
               
                  King.
                  To perish
               
               
                  Queen.
                  No,
                  To live to a blest old age with thee in freedom.
                  Away my Charles, my
                     King! I shall be safe—
                  And if I were not could I live if thou—
                  Charles, thou wilt madden me. 'Tis the first boon
                  I ever craved;and now, by our young loves,
                  By our commingled griefs, a mighty spell,
                  Our smiling children and this bleeding land,
                  Go! I conjure thee, go!
               
               
                  King.
                  I cannot.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     King
                  
                  Begone! or I will speak such truth—and truth 
                  Is a foul treason in this land—will rain
                  Such curses on them, as shall force them to send me
                  To the scaffold at thy side. Fly!
               
               
                  Charles.
                  Dost thou see 
                  Fierce soldiers crowded round, as if to watch 
                  A garrisoned fort, rather than one unarmed
                  Defenceless man, and think'st thou I could win 
                  A step unchallenged? Nor though to escape 
                  Were easy as to breathe, the vigilant guard
                  Smitten with sudden blindness, the unnumbered
                  And stirring swarms of this vast city locked
                  In charmed sleep, and darkness over all
                  Blacker than starless night, spectral and dim
                  As an eclipse at noontide, though the gates
                  Opened before me,and my feet were swift
                  As the Antelope's, not then if it but perilled
                  A single hair of friend or foe would I
                  Pass o'er the threshold. In my cause too much
                  Of blood hath fallen. Let mine seal all. I go
                  To death as to a bridal; thou thyself
                  In thy young beauty was not welcomer
                  Than he. Farewell, beloved wife! My chosen!
                  My dear- one! We have loved as peasants
                  
                  
                  Been fond and true as theyNow fare thee well!
                  I thank thee,and I bless thee. Pray for me,
                  My Henrietta.
               
               
                  Queen.
                  
                     Charles, thou shalt be saved. 
                  Talk not of parting. I'll to Fairfax; he 
                  Gave hope, and hope is life.
               
               
                  Charles.
                  Farewell!
               
               
                  Queen.
                  That word—
                  I prythee speak it not—withers me, lives 
                  Like a serpent's hiss within mine ear, shouts through
                  My veins like poison, twines and coils about me
                  Clinging and killing. 'Tis a sound accurst,
                  A word of death and doom. Why shouldst thou speak it?
                  Thou shalt be saved; Fairfax shall save thee. Charles,
                  Give me a ringlet of thy hair—No, no—
                  Not now! Not now!Thou shalt not die.
               
               
                  King.
                  Sweet wife,
                  Say to my children that my last fond thought—
               
               
                  Queen.
                  Last! Thou shalt live to tell them of thy thoughts
                  Longer than they or I to hear thee. Harken
                  Promise thou wilt await me here! Let none— 
                  They will not dare, they shall not. I but waste
                  The hour. To Fairfax,
                     the good Fairfax! Charles
                  
                  Thou shalt not die
               
               (Exit Queen.)
               
                  King.
                  Oh truest fondest woman! 
                  My matchless wife! The pang is mastered now,
                  I am Death's conqueror. My Faithfullest! 
                  My Fairest! My mostdear! I ne'er shall see 
                  Those radiant looks again, or hear the sound
                  Of thy b voice, which was a hope, or feel
                  The thrilling pressure of thy hand, almost
                  A language, so the ardent spirit burned
                  And vibrated within thee! I'll to prayer,
                  And chase away that image! I'll to prayer,
                  And pray for thee, sweet wife! I'll to my prayers.
               
               Exit.
            
            
               SCENE II.
               —The Banquetting-House at Whitehall, glass folding-doors opening to the Scaffold, which is covered with black. The block, axe, &c. visible ; Officers and other persons are busy inthe background, and Cromwell is also there giving directions.
               
               
                  Har.
                  
                     Cromwell!—Good-morrow Ireton!Whither goes
                  The General?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  To see that all be ready
                  For this great deed.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  He hath the eager step,
                  The dark light in his eye, the upward look,
                  The flush upon his cheek, that I've marked in him
                  When marching to the battle.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Doth he not lead
                  To day in a great combat, a most holy
                  And glorious victory?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  (at the back of the Stage)
                  Hast thou ta'en order
                  That soon as the head's off the 
                        Abbey bell
                  Begin to toll?
               
               
                  Officer.
                  I have.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Look that the axe
                  Be keen,and the hand steady. Let us have
                  No butchery.
                  (advancing to the front of the Stage.)
                  If he die not, we must perish—
                  That were as nothing! but with us will die
                  The liberty for which the blood of saints
                  And martyrs hath been spilt, freedom of act,
                  Of speech, of will, of faith! Better one grey 
                  Discrowned head should fall, albeit a thought
                  Before the time, than God's own people groan
                  In slavery forever.
               
               
                  Har.
                  Whoso doubteth
                  But he shall die?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis rumoured, Sirs, amongst ,
                  The soldiery, that one of a high place,
                  
                     Fairfax—But I believe
                     it not. Hast thou
                  The Warrant Hacker?
                  
               
               
                  Hack.
                  No.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Since when doth Fairfax
                  
                  Dare to impugn the sentence of a free 
                  And publick court, of England—
               
               
                  Har.
                  Of the Great
                  All-Righteous Judge who hath delivered him
                  Manifestly to us?
               
               
                  
                  Will he dare oppose 
                  
                     Armyand people? He alone!
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Be sure
                  The good Lord-General, howsoe'er some scruple
                  May trouble him, will play a godly part
                  In this sad drama.—Aye, I have the Warrant!
                  It is addressed to thee. Thou must receive
                  The prisoner,and conduct him hither.
               
               
                  Hack.
                  Hath
                  The hour been yet resolved?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Not that I hear.
                  Enter Fairfax.
                  Ha! our great General! Well met my Lord!
                  We that are laden with this heavy burthen
                  Lacked your sustaining aid!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  
                     Cromwell, I too
                  Am heavy-laden.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  You look ill at ease;
                  'Tis this chill air, the nourisher of rheums,
                  The very fog of frost, that turns men's blood
                  To water.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  No, the grief is here. Regret,
                  Almost remorse, and doubt and fear of wrong
                  Press heavily upon me. Is this death
                  Lawful?
               
               
                  Ire.
                  His country's sentence, good my Lord, 
                  May be thy warrant.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  An anointed King!
               
               
                  Har.
                  A bloody tyrant.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet a man, whose doom 
                  Lies on our conscience. We might save the King
                  
                  Even now at the eleventh hour; we two 
                  Hold the nice scales of life and death, and shall not
                  Fair mercy sway the balance? Dost thou hear me?
                  Wilt thou not answer? Canst thou doubt our power?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  No. Man hath always power for ill. I know
                  We might desert our friends, betray our country,
                  Abandon our great cause, and sell our souls
                  To Hell. We might do this,and more; might shroud
                  These devilish sins in holy names, and call them
                  Loyalty, Honour, Faith, Repentance—cheats
                  Which the great Tempter loves!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet harken,Cromwell!
                  Bethink thee of thy fame
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Talk'st thou of fame
                  To me? I am too mean a man, too lowly,
                  Too poor in state and name to need abjure
                  That princely sin, and for my humbleness
                  I duly render thanks. Were I as thou—
                  Beware the lust of fame, Lord
                        General,
                  Of perishable fame, vain breath of man,
                  Slight bubble, frailer than the ocean foam
                  Which from her prow the good ship in her course
                  Scattereth and passeth on regardlessly.
                  Lord General beware!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I am Lord General;
                  And I alone by mine own voice have power
                  To stay this deed.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Alone?
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I'll answer it
                  Before the Council.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Ha! alone!—come nearer.
               
               
               
                  Fair.
                  What would'st thou of me?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Yonder men are firm
                  And honest in the cause, and brave as steel;
                  Yet are they zealots, blind and furious zealots! 
                  I would not they should hear us—bloody zealots!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Speak, Sir; we waste the hour.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I would confess
                  Relentings like thine own.—They hear us not?
               
               
                  Fair.
                  I joy to hear thee.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Thou art one elect,
                  A leader in the land, a chosen vessel,
                  And yet of such a mild and gracious mood,
                  That I, stern as I seem, may doff to thee
                  This smooth and governed mask of polity, 
                  And shew the struggling heart perplexed and grieved
                  In all its nakedness. Yes, I have known
                  The kindly natural love of man to man
                  His fellow!—the rough soldier's shuddering hate
                  Of violent death, save in the battle; lastly 
                  A passionate yearning for that sweetest power
                  Born of fair Mercy.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Yet but now thou chidd'st me
                  And with a lofty scorn for such 
                        
                     a weakness.
                  The change is sudden.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Good my lord, I strove 
                  And wrestled with each pitying thought as born
                  Of earthly pride and mortal sin. Full oft
                  We, that are watchers of our wretched selves,
                  Aiming at p
                     higher virtues, trample down
                  Fair shoots of charity and gentle love
                  Yet still my breast was troubled. and since thou
                  Art moved by such relentings—
               
               
                  Fair.
                  And a promise 
                  Made to my wife
               
               
                  Crom.
                  A wise and pious lady!
               
               
                  Fair.
                  Thou wilt then save the King?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Sir,  we must have 
                  Some higher warrantry than our wild will,
                  Our treacherous human will, afore we change
                  The fiat of a nation. Thou art a man
                  Elect and godly—Harrison!—go seek 
                  The presence of the Lord. Perhaps to thee
                  A guiding answer, a divine impulsion,
                  May be vouchsafed. Go with him Harrison! 
                  Seek ye the Lord together.
               
               
                  Fair.
                  'Tis a wise
                  And pious counsel.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Step apart awhile;
                  We will await ye here.
                  Exeunt FairfaxandHarrison. 
                  
                     Cromwell gives
                           the Warrant to Hacker.)
                  Now! now! be quick! 
                  (Exit Hacker.)
                  Is the scaffold all prepared? The headsman waiting
                  With shrouded visage and bare arm? The axe 
                  Whetted? Be ready on the instant. Where
                  Be guards to line the room, mute wondering faces,
                  A living tapestry, and men of place 
                  To witness this great deed? A King should fall
                  Decked with the pageantries of Death, the clouds
                  That roll around the setting sun.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  If Fairfax
                  
                  Return before he come—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Dost thou mistrust
                  
                     Harrison's gift in
                     prayer? The General's safe. 
                  Besides I sent erewhile the Halberdiers
                  To guard Charles
                        Stuart hither. Hacker'll
                     meet
                  His prisoner.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  But should Fairfax—
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore waste
                  A word on such a waverer!
               
               
                  Ire.
                  What hath swayed him?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  His wife! his wife! The Queen hath seen again
                  That haughty dame, and her fond tears—
               
               
                  Ire.
                  I marvel
                  That thou endur'st that popish witch of
                        France
                  
                  So near.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  I watch her. He must die! 'Tis borne
                  Upon my soul as what shall be. The race,
                  The name shall perish.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  Aye, the very name
                  Of King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Of Stuart.
                  
               
               
                  Ire.
                  And of King.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  So be it.
                  Will Bradshaw never come?
                  
                     Bradshaw, Cook, Marten, and others.
                  Ah welcome! welcome!
                  Ye are late.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Yon living mass is hard to pierce
                  By men of civil calling. The armed soldiers
                  Can scantly force a passage for their prisoner.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  He comes?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  He's at the gate.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  What say the people?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The most are pale and silent, as a Fear
                  Hung its dull shadow over them; whilst some
                  Struck with a sudden pity weep and wonder 
                  What ails them; and a few bold tongues are loud
                  In execration.
               
               
                  Ire.
                  And the soldiers?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  They
                  Are true to the good cause.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  The righteous cause!
                  My friends and comrades ye are come to witness
                  The mighty consummation. See, the sun
                  Breaks forth! The Heavens look down upon our work
                  Smiling! The Lord hath risen!
               
               
                  Ire.
                  The King!
               
               Enter the King, Hacker,
                     Herbert, a Bishop, Guards, &c.
               
                  King.
                  Why pause ye?
                  Come on.
               
               
                  Herbert gives the
                        King a letter.
               
                  Herb.
                  Sire, from thy Son.
               
               
                  King.
                  My boy! My boy!
                  No; no; this letter is of life, and I 
                  And life have shaken hands. My kingly boy!
                  And the fair girl! I thought to have done with this.
                  But it so clings! Take back the letter,Herbert.
                  Take it, I say. Forgive me, faithful Herbert,
                  That last impatient word. Forgive me. Now, Sirs,
                  What see ye on that platform? I am as one
                  Bent on a far and perilous voyage, who seeks
                  To hear what rocks beset his path. What see ye?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Only the black-masked headsman.
               
               
                  King.
                  Aye, he wears 
                  His mask upon his face, an honest mask.
                  What see ye more?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Nought save the living sea
                  Of human faces, blent into one mass
                  Of sentient various life: woman and man, 
                  Childhood and infancy,and youth and age,
                  Commingled with its multitudinous eyes
                  Upturned in expectation. Aweful gaze!
                  Who may abide thy power?
               
               
                  King.
                  I shall look upward.
                  Why pause we here?
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Aye, why?
               
               
                  Brad.
                  May it please thee, Sir,
                  To rest awhile? Bring wine.
               
               
                  King.
                  I need it not. 
                  Yes! fill the cup! fill high the sparkling cup!
                  This is a holiday to loyal breasts,
                  The King's accession day. Fill high! fill high!
                  The block, the scaffold, the  swift sudden axe,
                  Have yet a privilege beyond the slow
                  And painful dying bed, and I may quaff 
                  In my full pride of strength a health to him,
                  Whom, pass one short half-hour, the funeral knell
                  Proclaims my successor.  Health to my son!
                  Health to the King of England! Start ye, Sirs,
                  To hear the word? Health to King Charles,and peace,
                  To this fair realm! And when that blessed time
                  Of rightful rule shall come, say that I left
                  For the bold traitors that condemned, the cowards
                  Whonot opposing murdered me(I have won
                  So near the Throne of Truth that
                     true words spring
                  Unbidden from my lips,) say that I left
                  A pardon, liberal as the air, to all,
                  A free and
                        
                      royal pardon!—Prythee speed me
                  On my rough journey.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Wherefore crowd ye there?
                  Make way.
               
               
                  King.
                  I thank thee, Sir. My good Lord Bishop,
                  Beware the step.—
               
               (Exeunt King, Herbert, Bishop, and Guards. A
                        pause.)
               
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Doth he address the people?
               
               
                  Mar.
                  Not so. He kneels.
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Twere fittest. Close the door.
                  This wintery air is chill, and the Lord President
                  Is of a feeble body.
               
               (Scream without.)
               
               
                  Brad.
                  Hush! 
               
               
                  Crom.
                  'Tis one
                  Who must be stayed.
               
               
                  Brad.
                  The Queen? 
               
               
                  Crom.
                  Go stop her,Ireton.
                  (Exit Ireton.)
                  It were not meet that earthly loves should mingle
                  With yonder dying prayer. Yes! Still he kneels.
                  
                     Hacker come hither. If thou see a stir
                  Amongst the crowd, send for my horse; they're ready;—
                  Or if, midst  grave men, some feeble heart 
                  Wax faint in the great cause, as such there be;—
                  Or on the scaffold, if he cling to life
                  Too fondly;—I'd not send a sinful soul
                  Before his time to his accompt, good Bradshaw!
                  But no delay!Is he still kneeling?—Mark me
                  No idle dalliance Hacker! I must hence,
                  Lest Fairfax—no weak dalliance! no delay!
                  The cause, the cause, good Bradshaw!
               
               (Exit and the Scene closes.)
            
         
         
            SCENE II.
            Another Gallery in Whitehall.
            Enter Cromwell.
            
               Crom.
               Methought I heard her here.—No!—if she win 
               To Fairfax!—he must die, as Ahab erst
               Or Rehoboam, or as that great heathen
               Whom Brutus loved and slew. None ever called
               
                  Brutus a murderer! And
                     Charles had trial—
               'Twas more than Caesar had!—free open trial,
               If he had pleaded. But the Eternal Wrath
               Stiffened him in his pride. It was ordained,
               And I but an impassive instrument 
               In the Almighty hand, an arrow chosen
               From out the sheaf. If I should reign hereafter 
               Men shall not call me bloody.—Hark! the bell!
               No—all is hush as midnight.—I shall be 
               Tenderer of English lives. Have they forgot
               To sound the bell? He must be dead.
            
            
               Queen.
               (without)
               
                  Lord Fairfax!
            
            
               Crom.
               The Queen! the Queen!
            
            Enter the Queen
            
            
               Queen.
               They told me he was here— 
               I see him not,—but I have wept me blind;—
               And then that axe, that keen, bright, edgy axe,
               Which flashed across my eyeballs, blinding me
               More than a sea of tears.—Here's one!: — Oh fly
               If thou be man, and bid the headsman stay
               His blow for one short hour, one little hour,
               Till I have found Lord Fairfax! Thou shalt
                  have 
               Gold, mines of gold! Oh save him! Save the King!
            
            
               Crom.
               Peace! peace! Have comfort!
            
            
               Queen.
               Comfort! and he dies,
               They murder him; the axe falls on his neck;
               The blood comes plashing;—Comfort!
            
            Enter Lady
               Fairfax
            
            
               Lady F.
               Out alas!
               I can hear nought of Fairfax, royal Madam!—
               
                  Cromwell, the Master-murderer!
            
            
               Queen.
               Oh forgive her!
               She knows not what she says. If thou be Cromwell
               
               Thou hast the power to rescue: See I kneel;
               I kiss thy feet. Oh save him! Take the crown;
               Take all but his dear life! Oh save him, save him!
               And I will be thy slave!—I, a born Princess,
               I, a crowned Queen, will be thy slave.
            
            
               Crom.
               Arise!
               My Lady Fairfax lead this frantic
                  woman
               To where her children bide.
            
            
               Queen.
               Thou wilt not make
               My children fatherless? Oh mercy! Mercy!
               I have a girl, a weeping innocent girl,
               That never learnt to smile, and she shall be
               Thy handmaid; she shall tend thy daughters. I,
               That was so proud, offer my fairest child 
               To be thy bondwoman.
            
            
               Crom.
               Raise her! Undo
               These clasping hands. I marvel,Lady
                  Fairfax,
               Thou canst endure to see a creature kneel
               To one create.
            
            
               Lady F.
               Out on thee,hypocrite!
               Where lags my husband?
            
            
               Queen.
               Save him, save him,Cromwell!
               
            
            
               Crom.
               Woman arise! Will this long agony
               Endure forever?
               Enter Ireton, on one side,
                  followed by Fairfax and Harrison on the other.
               Is he dead?
            
            
               Fair.
               What means
               This piercing outcry?
            
            
               Queen.
               
                  Fairfax! He is saved!
               He is saved!
            
            
               Ire.
               The bell! the Abbey bell! Hark!
            
            
               Crom.
               There
               The will of Heaven spake. The King is dead.
            
            
               Fair.
               Look to the Queen. Cromwell, this bloody
                  work
               Is thine.
            
            
               Crom.
               This work is mine. For yon sad dame,
               She shall away to France. This
                  deed is mine,
               And I will answer it. The Commonwealth
               Is firmly 'stablished Ireton. Harrison,
               The Saints shall rule in Israel. My Lord General,
               The army is thine own, and I a soldier,
               A lowly follower in the cause.

                  This deed
               
               Is mine.—
