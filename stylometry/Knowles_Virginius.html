<h4>
<center>PROLOGUE, BY J. H. REYNOLDS, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MISS BOOTH. [By Reynolds, J. H.] </center>
</h4>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<em>[Speaking behind.]</em>
<br>

<br>Nay, Mr. Fawcett, give me leave, I pray: 
<br>The audience wait, and I must have my way. 
<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em>[Enters.</em>
<br>

<br>What! curb a woman's tongue!---as I'm alive, 
<br>The wretch would mar our old prerogative! 
<br>Ladies! by very dint of pertinacity, 
<br>Have I preserved the glory of loquacity.

<br>
<br>

<br>Oh! could you gaze, as I am gazing now, 
<br>And see each man behind with gather'd brow, 
<br>And clench&eacute;d hand (though nought my spirit damps), 
<br>Beckoning, with threats, my presence from the lamps: 
<br>Each, as I broke my way, declared how well 
<br>His art could woo you---to be peaceable! 
<br>One is well robed---a second greatly shines, 
<br>
In the nice balance---of
<em>cast-iron</em>
lines;

<br>A third can sing---a fourth can touch your tears--- 
<br>A fifth---"I'll see no more!"---a fifth appears, 
<br>Who hath been once in Italy, and seen Rome; 
<br>In short---there's quite a hubbub in the Green-Room. 
<br>But I---a very woman---careless, light--- 
<br>Fleet idly to your presence, this fair night; 
<br>And, craving your sweet pardon, fain would say 
<br>A kind word for the poet and his play.

<br>
<br>

<br>To-night, no idle nondescript lays waste 
<br>The fairy and yet placid bower of taste: 
<br>No story, piled with dark and cumbrous fate, 
<br>And words, that stagger under their own weight; 
<br>But one of silent grandeur---simply said, 
<br>As though it were awaken'd from the dead! 
<br>It is a tale---made beautiful by years;--- 
<br>Of pure, old Roman sorrow---old in tears! 
<br>And those you shed o'er it in childhood may 
<br>Still fall---and fall---for sweet Virginia!

<br>
<br>

<br>Nor doth a crown&eacute;d poet of the age 
<br>Call the sweet spirits from the historic page! 
<br>No old familiar dramatist hath spun 
<br>This tragic, antique web, to-night---but one, 
<br>An unknown author, in a sister land, 
<br>Waits, in young fear, the fiat of your hand.

<center>
<em>---A Street in Rome.</em>
</center>
<br>

<br>
<center>
<em>
Enter
<strong>Servius</strong>
and
<strong>Cneius</strong>
.
</em>
</center>
<br>

<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
Carbo denied a hearing!
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Cne.</em>

<p>
Ay, and Marcellus cast into prison, because he sued 
a friend of one of the decemvirs for a sum of money he had 
lent him.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
And Appius resisted not? Appius, that in the first 
decemvirate was a god to the people!
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Cne.</em>

<p>
Resisted not! Nay, was most loud in favour of the 
decree; but hither comes Virginius, who interested himself so 
much in Carbo's affair. He looks a little heated. Is not that 
Titus he is speaking to? Stand aside, master, and listen.
</p>



<br>
<center>
<em>
Enter
<strong>Virginius</strong>
and
<strong>Titus</strong>
.
</em>
</center>
<br>

<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Why did you make him decemvir, and first 
decemvir too?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
We had tried him, and found him honest.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
And could you not have remained content? Why 
try him again to find him dishonest? Knew ye not he was a 
patrician, and of the Claudian family?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
He laid down the consulate---
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Ha! ha! ha!---to be elected into the decemvirate, 
and he was so; and he laid down his office of decemvir 
to be re-elected into the decemvirate, and he is so; ay, by 
Jupiter! and to the exclusion of his late colleagues! Did not 
Titus Genutius lay down the consulate?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
He did.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Was he not next to Appius in the decemvirate?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>

<small>[25]</small>&nbsp;
			He was.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Did you not find him honest?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
We did find him honest.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
As honest as Appius Claudius?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
Quite as honest.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Quite as honest!---and why not re-elect him 
decemvir? Most sapient people! You re-elect Appius into 
the decemvirate for his honesty, and you thrust Titus out of 
the decemvirate---I suppose for his honesty also! Why, 
Appius was sick of the decemvirate.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
I never heard him say so.

<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
But he did say so---say so in my hearing; in 
presence of the senators Valerius and Caius Claudius, and I 
don't know how many others. 'Twas known to the whole 
body of the senate---not that he was sick, but that he said so. 
Yes, yes; he and his colleagues, he said, had done the work of 
the republic for a whole year, and it was now but just to grant 
them a little repose, and appoint others to succeed them.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
Well, well, we can only say he changed his mind.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
No, no, we needn't say that neither! As he had 
laboured in the decemvirate, perhaps he thought he might as 
well repose in the decemvirate.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
I know not what he thought. He is decemvir, and we 
made him so, and cannot help ourselves. Fare you well, Virginius. 
Come, let's to the Forum.

			You cannot help yourselves! Indeed you cannot: 
<br>You help'd to put your masters on your backs: 
<br>They like their seat, and make you show your paces. 
<br>They ride you---sweat you---curb you---lash you---and 
<br>You cannot throw them off with all your mettle! 
<br>But here comes one, whose share in giving you

<br>More nearly, for that I've an interest

<br>Worthy Virginius! 'tis an evil day 
<br>For Rome, that gives her more convincing proof, 
<br>The thing, she took for hope, is but a base 
<br>And wretched counterfeit! Our new decemvirs 
<br>Are anything but friends to justice and 
<br>Their country.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>You, Icilius, had a hand 
<br>In their election. You applied to me 
<br>To aid you with my vote in the comitia: 
<br>I told you then, and tell you, now, again, 
<br>I am not pleased when a patrician bends 
<br>His head to a plebeian's girdle. Mark me! 
<br>I'd rather he should stand aloof, and wear 
<br>His shoulder high---especially the nephew 
<br>Of Caius Claudius.


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>
<small>[75]</small>&nbsp;
			I would have pledged my life---


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>'Twas a high gage, and men have staked a higher 
<br>On grounds as poor as yours---their honour, boy! 
<br>Icilius, I have heard it all---your plans--- 
<br>The understanding 'twixt the heads of the people--- 
<br>Of whom, Icilius, you are reckon'd one, and 
<br>Worthily---and Appius Claudius---all!--- 
<br>'Twas every jot disclosed to me.


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>By whom?


<br>

<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Siccius Dentatus.

<br>He disclosed it to you? 
<br>Siccius Dentatus is a crabb&eacute;d man.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Siccius Dentatus is an honest man! 
<br>There's not a worthier in Rome! How now! 
<br>Has he deceived me? Do you call him liar? 
<br>My friend! my comrade! honest Siccius, 
<br>That fought in six-score battles!


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>Good Virginius, 
<br>Siccius Dentatus is my friend---the friend 
<br>Of every honest man in Rome---a brave man--- 
<br>A most brave man. Except yourself, Virginius, 
<br>I do not know the man I prize above 
<br>Siccius Dentatus---yet he's a crabb&eacute;d man.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Yes, yes; he is a crabb&eacute;d man.


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>A man 
<br>
<small>[100]</small>&nbsp;
			Who loves too much to wear a jealous eye


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>No, not a whit, where he sees double dealing. 
<br>You are the best judge of your own concerns; 
<br>Yet, if it please you to communicate 
<br>With me upon this subject, come and see me. 
<br>I told you, boy, I favour'd not this stealing 
<br>And winding into place. What he deserves, 
<br>An honest man dares challenge 'gainst the world--- 
<br>But come and see me. Appius Claudius, chosen 
<br>Decemvir, and his former colleagues, that 
<br>Were quite as honest as himself, not chosen--- 
<br>No, not so much as named by him, who named 
<br>Himself, and his new associates! Well, 'tis true, 
<br>Dog fights with dog, but honesty is not 
<br>A cur, that baits his fellow---and e'en dogs, 
<br>By habit of companionship, abide 
<br>In terms of faith and cordiality--- 
<br>But come and see me.


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>Appius comes! 
<br>The people still throng after him with shouts, 
<br>Unwilling to believe their Jupiter 
<br>Has mark'd them for his thunder. Will you stay, 
<br>And see the homage that they render him?


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Not I! Stay you; and, as you made him, hail him; 
<br>And shout, and wave your hand, and cry, "Long live 
<br>

			Our first and last decemvir, Appius Claudius!" 
<br>For he is first and last, and every one! 
<br>Rome owes you much, Icilius---Fare you well---

By Jupiter, young man, had you thus stepped before

of furniture in the house of a friend of mine, that's called 
Virginius, I think you've set your heart upon---dainty enough; 
yet not amiss for a young man to covet. Ne'er lose your 
hopes! He may be brought into the mind to part with it. 
As to these curs, I question which I value less, their fawnings 
or their snarlings. I thank you, boy! Do you walk this 
way? I am glad of it. Come! 'Tis a noble decemvirate you

<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>And is this all you have observed? I think 
<br>There's nothing strange in that. An L and an I 
<br>Twined with a V. Three very innocent letters 
<br>To have bred such mischief in thy brain, good Servia. 
<br>Come, read this riddle to me.


<br>
<br>
<small><font color="red">

			</font></small>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


<em>Servia.</em>

<br>You may laugh, 
<br>Virginius; but I'll read the riddle right. 
<br>The L doth stand for Lucius; and the I, 
<br>Icilius; which, I take it, will compose, 
<br>"Lucius Icilius."


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>So it will, good Servia.


<br>
<br>


<em>Servia.</em>

<br>Then, for the V; why, that is plain, "Virginia."


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>And now, what conjuration find you here?


<br>
<br>


<em>Servia.</em>

<br>What should I find, but love? The maid's in love; 
<br>In love, and it is with Icilius. Look, the wreath 
<br>Is made of roses, that entwines the letters.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>And this is all?


<br>
<br>


<em>Servia.</em>

<br>And is it not enough? 
<br>You'll find this figuring where'er you look: 
<br>There's not a piece of dainty work she does--- 
<br>Embroidery, or painting---not a task 
<br>She finishes, but on the skirt, or border, 
<br>In needle-work, or pencil, this, her secret, 
<br>The silly wench betrays.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>
<small>[25]</small>&nbsp;
			Go, send her to me--- 
<br>Stay! Have you spoken to her of it?


<br>
<br>


<em>Servia.</em>

<br>I! 
<br>Not I, indeed; I left that task to you--- 
<br>Though once I ask'd her what the letters meant. 
<br>She laugh'd, and drew a scratch across them; but 
<br>Had scarce done so, ere her fair visage fell, 
<br>For grief that she had spoil'd the ciphers---and 
<br>A sigh came out, and then almost a tear; 
<br>And then she look'd as piteous on the harm 
<br>That she had done, as she had done it to 
<br>A thing had sense to feel it. Never after 
<br>She let me note her at her work again. 
<br>She had good reason!


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Send her to me, Servia.

<br>There's something here, that promises to bring me 
<br>Anticipation of my wish. I think 
<br>Icilius loves my daughter---nay, I know it; 
<br>And such a man would challenge for her husband;--- 
<br>And only waited, till her forward spring 
<br>Put on, a little more, the genial likeness 
<br>Of colouring into summer, ere I sought 
<br>To nurse a flower, which, blossoming too early, 
<br>Too early often dies; but if it springs 
<br>Spontaneous, and, unlook'd for, woos our hand 
<br>
<small>[50]</small>&nbsp;

<br>And 'twere untimely, as unkind, to check it.

<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>'Tis Homer's story, father, 
<br>Of brave Achilles parting from Briseis.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>You have done it well. The colouring is good, 
<br>The figures well design'd. 'Tis very well!--- 
<br>Whose face is this you've given to Achilles?


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Whose face?


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>I've seen this face! Tut! tut! I know it 
<br>As well as I do my own, yet can't bethink me 
<br>Whose face it is!


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>You mean Achilles' face?


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Did I not say so! 'Tis the very face 
<br>Of---No! no! Not of him. There's too much youth 
<br>And comeliness, and too much fire, to suit 
<br>The face of Siccius Dentatus.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Oh! 
<br>
<small>[100]</small>&nbsp;
			You surely never took it for his face!


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Why, no; for now I look again, I'd swear 
<br>You lost the copy, ere you drew the head; 
<br>And, to requite Achilles for the want 
<br>Of his own face, contrived to borrow one 
<br>
From Lucius Icilius.

<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Your news! What news?


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<p>
More violence and wrong from these new masters of 
ours---our noble decemvirs---these demi-gods of the good 
people of Rome! No man's property is safe from them. 
Nay, it appears we hold our wives and daughters but by the 
tenure of their will. Their liking is the law. The senators 
themselves, scared at their audacious rule, withdraw themselves 
to their villas, and leave us to our fate. There are 
rumours, also, of new incursions by the Sabines.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
Rome never saw such days!
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<p>
And she'll see worse, unless I fail in my reckoning. 
Is that Virginia? I saw her not before. How does the fair 
Virginia? Why, she is quite a woman. I was just now 
wishing for a daughter.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>A plague, you mean.


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<br>I am sure you should not say so.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Indeed he should not; and he does not say so, 
<br>
<small>[125]</small>&nbsp;
			Dentatus---not that I am not a plague, 
<br>But that he does not think me one, for all 
<br>I do to weary him. I am sure, Dentatus, 
<br>If to be thought to do well is to do well, 
<br>There's nothing I do ill; but it is far 
<br>From that! for few things do I as I ought--- 
<br>Yet everything is well done with my father, 
<br>Dentatus.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>That's well done, is it not, my friend? 
<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<em>[Aside.</em>
<br>

<br>But if you had a daughter, what would you do with her?


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<p>
I'd give her to Icilius. I should have been just now 
torn to pieces, but for his good offices. The gentle citizens--- 
that are driven about by the decemvirs' lictors, like a herd of 
tame oxen, and, with most beast-like docility, only low applauses 
to them in return---would have done me the kindness 
to knock my brains out; but the noble Icilius bearded them 
singly, and railed them into temper. Had I a daughter 
worthy of such a husband, he should have such a wife, and a 
patrician's dower along with her.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<p>
I wish to speak with you, Dentatus. Icilius is a 
young man, whom I honour; but so far only as his conduct 
gives me warrant. He has had, as thou knowest, a principal 
hand in helping us to our decemvirs. It may be that he is 
what I would gladly think him; but I must see him clearly, 
clearly, Dentatus. If he has acted with the remotest understanding, 
<small>[150]</small>&nbsp;
			touching the views of these new tyrants, that we are 
cursed withal, I disclaim him as my friend! I cast him off for 
ever!

<br>

<br>My father is incensed with thee. Dentatus

<br>How they abuse their office. You, he knows, 
<br>Have favour'd their election, and he fears 
<br>May have some understanding of their plans.

<br>Your eye is moist---yet that may be for pity. 
<br>Your hand doth tremble---that may be for fear; 
<br>Your cheek is cover'd o'er with blushes! What, 
<br>O what can that be for?


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Icilius, leave me!


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>Leave thee, Virginia! O, a word---a word 
<br>Trembles upon my tongue, which, if it match 
<br>The thought that moves thee, now, and thou wilt let me 
<br>Pronounce that word, to speak that thought for thee, 
<br>I'll breathe, though I expire in the ecstasy 
<br>Of uttering it.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Icilius, will you leave me?


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>Love! Love! Virginia! Love!---If I have spoken 
<br>Thy thought aright, ne'er be it said again, 
<br>The heart requires more service than the tongue

<p>
'Tis all confirmed, then; the Sabines are in force upon 
our borders.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<p>
I pray you tell me something new! Know you not 
that the senate has met, and that the decemvirs have come off 
triumphant, in spite of all opposition?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
Should they have been opposed in such a strait as this?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<p>
Ay, should they! They dared not have armed a 
single citizen without the order of the senate; which, had they 
not obtained, the country would have been left naked to the 
foe; and, then, they had been forced to make room for more 
popular magistrates.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
Why were they not opposed, then?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<p>

<small>[25]</small>&nbsp;
			
Did not I tell you they
<em>were</em>
opposed? Caius Claudius,

Appius's own uncle, and Honorius, that noble senator, opposed 
them; and it was like to go against them, but for the brawling 
insolence of Spurius Oppius, and the effrontery of the head 
decemvir, backed by the young patricians.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
So they are empowered to take up arms?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<p>
To be sure they are; and they have done so. One 
body has already marched, and by this time, no doubt, has 
come to blows with the enemy. The levy is still proceeding. 
All the decemvirs, but Appius, take the field. He remains in 
Rome to keep good order, that is the violator of all order. 
Why, where have you been, Lucius, to have felt no movement 
of so great and wide a stir? Your brother meets Virginius at 
his house to-day. Come with me thither, for you I know are 
bid. Lucius, there's no huzzaing for your decemvirs now. 
Come on! 'Tis close upon the hour.

<br>Dissolved---o'erpower'd with the munificence 
<br>Of this auspicious hour---and thou, nor movest--- 
<br>Nor look'st---nor speak'st---to bless me with a sign 
<br>Of sweet according joy!---I love thee, but 
<br>To make thee happy! If to make thee so 
<br>Be bliss denied to me---lo, I release 
<br>The gifted hand---that I would faster hold, 
<br>Than wretches, bound for death, would cling to life. 
<br>If thou wouldst take it back---then take it back.


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>I take it back---to give it thee again!


<br>
<br>


<em>Icil.</em>

<br>O help me to a word to speak my bliss, 
<br>Or I am beggar'd---No! There's no such word! 
<br>There cannot be; for never man had bliss 
<br>Like mine to name!


<br>
<br>


<em>Virginia.</em>

<br>Thou dost but beggar me, 
<br>Icilius, when thou makest thyself a bankrupt; 
<br>Placing a value on me far above 
<br>My real little worth.---I'd help thee to 
<br>A hundred words; each one of which would far 
<br>O'er-rate thy gain, and yet no single one 
<br>Rate over high!

			Writ down and doubled, then the whole summ'd up,

<br>Of soul and body that can blend in woman, 
<br>I would out-paragon the paragon 
<br>With thee!


<br>
<br>

<br>And if thou wouldst, I'd find thee, for 
<br>Thy paragon, a mate---if that can be 
<br>A mate which beats the thing 'tis ta'en to match--- 
<br>One that would make thy paragon look poor--- 
<br>And I would call that so o'ermatching mate 
<br>"Icilius."


<br>

<br>No! I will not let thee win 
<br>On such a theme as this!

<br>Nor will I drop 
<br>The controversy, that the richer makes me 
<br>The more I lose!

<br>Playing for nothing but to lose and win. 
<br>Then let us drop the game---and thus I stop it.

another month a Roman will be a stranger in Rome. A fine

Why, what would you have? You shout and clap your 
hands, as if it were a victory you heard of; and yet you cry--- 
Something must be done! Truly, I know not what that something 
is, unless it be to make you General. How say you, 
masters?

<p>
You made these decemvirs!---You are strangely discontented

workmen, too---You put your materials so firmly together, 
there's no such thing as taking them asunder! What you 
build, you build---except it be for your own good.---There you 
are bunglers at your craft. Ha! ha! ha! I cannot but laugh

Ay, the news---the newest that can be had; and the

<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<p>
It is not well done in you, Dentatus, to chafe a sore. 
It makes it rankle. If your surgery has learned no better, it 
should keep its hands to itself! You have very little to do, to 
busy yourself after this fashion.

<p>
I busy myself as I like, Appius Claudius.

</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<p>
Ha! dare you say so?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<p>
Dare! I have dared cry "Come on!" to a cohort of 
bearded warriors---Is it thy smooth face should appal me? 
Dare!---It never yet flurried me to use my arm---Shall I not, 
think you, be at my ease when I but wag my tongue? Dare, 
indeed!

<em>App.</em>

<p>
Your grey hairs should keep company with honester 
speech!

Shall I show you, Appius, the company they are wont 

to keep? Look here! and here
<br>
<em>[uncovering his forehead and showing scars]</em>

These are the vouchers of honest deeds---Such 
is the speech with which my grey hairs keep company. I tell 
you, to your teeth, the decemvirs bring themselves into contempt.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<p>
What, are they not serving their country at the head 
of her armies?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<p>
They'd serve her better in the body of her armies! 
<small>[75]</small>&nbsp;
			I'd name for thee a hundred centurions would make better 
generals! A common soldier of a year's active service would

<em>App.</em>

<br>Why now, Dentatus, I begin to know you; 
<br>I fancied you a man that loved to vent 
<br>His causeless anger in an under-breath, 
<br>And speak it in the ear---and only then 
<br>When there was safety! Such a one, you'll own, 
<br>Is dangerous; and to be trusted, as 
<br>A friend or foe, unworthy. But I see 
<br>You rail to faces! Have you not so much 
<br>Respect for Appius as to take him by 
<br>The hand, when he confesses you have some 
<br>Pretence to quarrel with his colleagues' plans, 
<br>And find fault with himself?---which yet, you'll own, 
<br>May quite as well be kindly done, Dentatus, 
<br>As harshly. Had you only to myself 
<br>Declared your discontents, the more you had rail'd, 
<br>The more I should have thank'd you.


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<br>
<small>[100]</small>&nbsp;
			Had I thought---


<br>

<em>App.</em>

<br>And have you been campaigning, then, so long, 
<br>And prosperously---and mistrust you, Siccius, 
<br>That a young scarless soldier, like myself, 
<br>Would listen to your tutoring? See, now, 
<br>How much you have mistaken me! Dentatus, 
<br>In a word---Can you assist the generals, 
<br>And will you?


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<br>I have all the will---but as 
<br>For the ability---


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Tut! tut! Dentatus, 
<br>You vex me now. This coyness sits not well on you! 
<br>You know as well as I, you have as much 
<br>Ability as will. I would not think you 
<br>A man that loved to find fault, but to find it! 
<br>Surely the evil you complain of, you 
<br>Would lend a hand to remedy! See, now, 
<br>'Tis fairly put to you---what say you?


<br>
<br>


<em>Den.</em>

<br>Appius, 
<br>You may use me as you please.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>And that will be, 
<br>As you deserve. I'll send you, as my legate, 
<br>
To the army.
<br>

Do you hear your friends, Dentatus?

<br>A lucky omen, that! Away! away! 
<br>Apprise your house---Prepare for setting out.

<small>[125]</small>&nbsp;
			I'll hurry your credentials. Minutes now 
<br>Rate high as hours! Assist my colleagues with 
<br>Your counsel; if their plans displease you, why 
<br>Correct them---change them---utterly reject them. 
<br>And if you meet obstruction, notice me, 
<br>And I will push it by. There, now! Your hand! 
<br>Again! Away! All the success attend you

<br>You send a messenger to-night?


<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<br>I do.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Paint me that smile! I never saw a smile 
<br>Till now. My Claudius, is she not a wonder? 
<br>I know not whether in the state of girlhood 
<br>Or womanhood to call her. 'Twixt the two 
<br>She stands, as that were loath to lose her, this 
<br>To win her most impatient. The young year 
<br>Trembling and blushing 'twixt the striving kisses 
<br>Of parting spring and meeting summer, seems 
<br>Her only parallel!


<br>
<br>


<em>Num.</em>

<br>'Tis well! I'll send 
<br>Your father word of this. But have you not 
<br>A message to Icilius?


<br>

<br>With what a gait she moves! Such was not Hebe, 
<br>Or Jupiter had sooner lost his heaven,

<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>'Tis difficult---her father's of repute;

<br>Are ever friends, except when they are needed.

<br>
<center>
<em>
<strong>Appius</strong>
[entering].
</em>
</center>
<br>

<br>It is not love, if what I've felt before 
<br>And call'd by such a name be love---a thing 
<br>That took its turn---that I could entertain, 
<br>Put off, or humour. 'Tis some other thing; 
<br>Or if the same, why in some other state--- 
<br>Or I am not the same---or it hath found 
<br>Some other part of sensibility 
<br>More quick, whereon to try its power, and there 
<br>Expends it all! Now, Claudius, your success?


<br>
<center>
<em>

<strong>Claudius</strong>
.
</em>

<br>

<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Nothing would do, yet nothing left undone! 
<br>She was not to be purchased.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Did she guess---


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>She could not. 
<br>So guarded was my agent; who described you 
<br>A man of power, of noble family, 
<br>And regal fortune---one that ask'd not what 
<br>His pleasures cost---no further made disclosure.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>And did it nothing move her, Claudius?


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Nothing. 
<br>The more my agent urged, the more the shrunk 
<br>And wither'd hag grew callous. Further press'd 
<br>And with more urgent importuning; ire 
<br>And scorn, in imprecations and invectives, 
<br>Vented upon the monster---as she call'd him--- 
<br>
<br>
<small><font color="red">

			</font></small>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<small>[25]</small>&nbsp;
			That would pollute her child, compell'd my advocate 
<br>To drop the suit she saw was hopeless.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Now 
<br>Had I a friend indeed!


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Has Appius need 
<br>To search for such a friend, and Claudius by him?


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Friends ever are provisionally friends--- 
<br>Friends for so far---friends just to such a point, 
<br>And then "farewell!"---friends with an understanding--- 
<br>As "should the road be pretty safe"---"the sea 
<br>
Not over-rough," and so on---friends of
<em>ifs</em>


<br>
And
<em>buts</em>
---no friends! O could I find the man

<br>Would be a simple thorough-going friend!


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>I thought you had one, Appius.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>So thought Appius, 
<br>Till Appius thought upon a test of friendship, 
<br>He fears he would not render to himself, 
<br>Could he be Appius' friend.


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Then Appius has 
<br>A truer friend than Appius is to Appius. 
<br>I'll give that test!


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>What! you'd remove her father 
<br>And that Icilius whom you told me of?


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Count it a thing already done.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>My Claudius! 
<br>
<small>[50]</small>&nbsp;
			Can I believe it? Art thou such a friend, 
<br>That, when I look'd for thee to stop and leave me, 
<br>I find thee, keeping with me, step by step; 
<br>And even in thy loving eagerness 
<br>Outstriding me?---I do not want thee, Claudius, 
<br>To soil thy hand with their plebeian blood.


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>What wouldst thou, then?


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>I was left guardian to thee---


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Thou wast.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Among the various property 
<br>Thy father left were many female slaves.


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Well?


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>It were easy for thee, were it not, 
<br>To invent a tale that one of them confess'd 
<br>She had sold a female infant (and, of course, 
<br>Thy slave) unto Virginius' wife, who pass'd it 
<br>Upon Virginius as his daughter, which 
<br>Supposititious offspring is this same 
<br>Virginia.


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>I conceive you.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>To induce 
<br>Your agent to confirm your tale would cost 
<br>But small persuasion. Is it done?


<br>
<br>


<em>Claud.</em>

<br>This hour! 
<br>I'll find the school, my Appius, where Virginia 
<br>
<small>[75]</small>&nbsp;
			Pursues her studies. Thither I'll repair, 
<br>And seize her as my slave, at once. Do thou

			</font></small>
<br>
<br>

<br>Repair to thy tribunal, whither, should 
<br>Her friends molest me in the attempt, I'll bring her, 
<br>And plead my cause before thee.


<br>
<br>


<em>App.</em>

<br>Claudius! Claudius! 
<br>How shall I pay thee? O, thou noble friend! 
<br>Power, fortune, life, whate'er belongs to Appius, 
<br>Reckon as thine! Away, away, my Claudius!

<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
Well, masters, any news of Siccius Dentatus from the 
camp, how he was received by the decemvirs?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
He was received well by the decemvirs.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Cne.</em>

<p>
It wasn't then for the love they bear him.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Tit.</em>

<p>
But they expect he'll help them to return the cuffs they 
have gotten from the enemy.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
Do you wish for a victory?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
Yes, if Dentatus wins it. 'Tis to our credit, masters 
---He's one of us.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
And is not Spurius Oppius one of us?
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Luc.</em>

<p>
He is; but he's in league with the patricians---that is, 
the patrician decemvirs. He is but half a plebeian, and that 
is the worst half. The better half he threw away when he 
became half a patrician. I never liked your half-and-half 
gentry; they generally combine the bad of both kinds, without 
the good of either.
</p>



<br>
<br>


<em>Ser.</em>

<p>
Well, we shall have news presently. Your brother, 
Icilius, has just arrived with despatches from the camp. I 
met him passing through the Forum, and asked him what 
news he brought. He answered, none; but added, we might 
look for news of another kind than what we had been lately 
accustomed to hear.

<em>Num.</em>

<br>I!

<br>

<em>Claud.</em>

<br>Numitorius, 
<br>You think yourself her uncle---Numitorius, 
<br>No blood of yours flows in her veins, to give you 
<br>The title that you claim. Most noble Appius! 
<br>If you sit here for justice, as I hope 
<br>You do, attend not to the clamour of 
<br>
This man, who calls himself this damsel's
<em>uncle</em>
.

<br>She is my property---was born beneath 
<br>My father's roof, whose slave her mother was, 
<br>Who---as I can establish past dispute--- 
<br>Sold her, an infant, to Virginius' wife, 
<br>Who never had a child, and heavily 
<br>Revolved her barrenness. My slave I have found 
<br>And scized---as who that finds his own (no matter 
<br>How long so ever miss'd) should fear to take it? 
<br>
<small>[50]</small>&nbsp;
			If they oppose my claim, let them produce 
<br>Their counter-proofs, and bring the cause to trial! 
<br>But till they prove I know not what's mine own--- 
<br>An undertaking somewhat perilous--- 
<br>Mine own I shall retain---yet giving them, 
<br>Should they demand it, what security 
<br>They please for re-producing her.

Dentatus is no more; but he has dearly sold his life. 
The matter has been reported as you directed. By few it is 
received with credence---by many with doubt; while some 
bold spirits stop not at muttering, but loudly speak suspicion 
of foul play. A party that we met, a mile beyond the lines, 
no sooner heard our story, than they set off to bring the body 
to the camp. Others have followed them. Fabius, we have 
your gage for safety.

<br>On whose white locks the mother look'd more proudly

<br>Dragg'd her to

<br>I would be patient.


<br>
<br>

<br>Numitorius there 
<br>Confronted him.

<br>Well? well? The issue?---Well?---O'erleap all else, 
<br>And light upon the issue! Where is she?

<br>I was despatch'd to fetch thee, ere I could learn.

			The claim of Claudius, Appius' client---Ha! 
<br>I see the master cloud!---This ragged one, 
<br>That lowers before, moves only in subservience 
<br>To the ascendant of the other---Jove, 
<br>With its own mischief break it and disperse it, 
<br>And that be all the ruin! Patience! Prudence! 
<br>Nay, prudence, but no patience. Come!---A slave--- 
<br>Dragg'd through the streets in open day! My child! 
<br>My daughter! my fair daughter, in the eyes 
<br>Of Rome! O, I'll be patient!---Come!---The essence 
<br>Of my best blood in the free common ear

<br>Into the likeness of her own. When first 
<br>She placed thee in my arms---I recollect it 
<br>As a thing of yesterday!---she wish'd, she said, 
<br>That it had been a man. I answer'd her, 
<br>It was the mother of a race of men, 
<br>And paid her for thee with a kiss. Her lips 
<br>Are cold now---could they be but warm'd again,

<br>I will not take him by the throat and strangle him! 
<br>But I could do it! I could do it! Fear not: 
<br>I will not strike while any head I love

<br>Let the Forum wait for us! 
<br>Put on no show of fear, when villany 
<br>Would wrestle with you! It can keep its feet 
<br>Only with cowards! I shall walk along 
<br>Slowly and calmly, with my daughter thus 
<br>In my hand---though with another kind of gripe

			But gives the port of impudence to falsehood,

<br>To ask him if she'll swear---Will she walk or run, 
<br>Sing, dance, or wag her head; do anything 
<br>That is most easy done? She'll as soon swear! 
<br>What mockery it is to have one's life 
<br>In jeopardy by such a barefaced trick! 
<br>Is it to be endured? I do protest

<br>It is my oath.

			'Tis not with men, as shrubs and trees, that by 
<br>The shoot you know the rank and order of 
<br>The stem. Yet who from such a stem would look 
<br>For such a shoot? My witnesses are these--- 
<br>The relatives and friends of Numitoria, 
<br>Who saw her, ere Virginia's birth, sustain 
<br>The burden which a mother bears, nor feels 
<br>The weight, with longing for the sight of it! 
<br>Here are the ears that listen'd to her sighs 
<br>In nature's hour of labour, which subsides 
<br>In the embrace of joy!---the hands, that when 
<br>The day first look'd upon the infant's face, 
<br>And never look'd so pleased, help'd her up to it, 
<br>And thank'd the gods for her, and pray'd them send 
<br>Blessing on blessing on her.---Here, the eyes

<br>That's strange enough. Why does he not dispute

<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>Who says that? 
<br>He lies in the face of the gods! She is immutable, 
<br>Immaculate, and immortal!---and though all 
<br>The guilty globe should blaze, she will spring up 
<br>Through the fire, and soar above the crackling pile, 
<br>With not a downy feather ruffled by 
<br>Its fierceness!

<br>


<em>Virginius.</em>

<br>That she nursed 
<br>The child herself! Inquire among your gossips,

<br>As can avouch the fact, without delay 
<br>Repair to the Forum! Will she come or not? 
<br>I'll call myself!---She will not dare!---O when 
<br>Did my Virginia dare---Virginia! 
<br>Is it a voice, or nothing answers me? 
<br>I hear a sound so fine---there's nothing lives

<br>Aha! She is not here! 
<br>They told me she was here---they have deceived me; 
<br>And Appius was not made to give her up, 
<br>But keeps her, and effects his wicked purpose, 
<br>While I stand talking here, and ask you if 
<br>My daughter is my daughter! Though a legion 
<br>Sentried that brothel, which he calls his palace, 
<br>I'd tear her from him!


<br>

<br>To pace it back again? I know of none. 
<br>I am as one that's dead! The dungeon, that 
<br>Encloses fallen greatness, may as well 
<br>Be call'd its tomb. I am as much the carcass

<br>


<em>Vibul.</em>

<br>Not out of such a cup as that, my Appius. 
<br>Despair, that bids you drink it, as the cure

<br>Your eyes from hope, that even now stands ready 
<br>With outstretch'd arms to rush to your embrace. 
<br>Your friends are busy for you with your foes! 
<br>Your foes become your friends! Where'er a frown 
<br>Appears against you, nothing's spared to make 
<br>The wearer doff it, and put up a smile 
<br>In its stead. Your colleague Oppius is in prison. 
<br>Your client too. Their harm's your safety: it 
<br>Distracts the appetite o' the dogs. They drop 
<br>The morsel they took up before, as soon 
<br>As a new one's thrown to them.


<br>

<br>Thou givest me life 
<br>Indeed!

<h4>
<center>EPILOGUE, BY BARRY CORNWALL, ESQ. SPOKEN BY MISS BRUNTON. [By Cornwall, B.] </center>
</h4>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>

<strong>Leaving</strong>
the common path, which many tread,

<br>We will not wake with jokes our poet dead; 
<br>Nor shame the young creations of his pen, 
<br>By bidding all, who've perish'd, be again. 
<br>The pale Virginia, in her bloody shroud, 
<br>Lies like a shrin&eacute;d saint.---Oh! then, aloud 
<br>Shall we break scurril jests, and bid depart 
<br>Those thoughts of her, which fill and teach the heart? 
<br>No moral now we offer, squared in form, 
<br>But Pity, like the sun-light, bright and warm, 
<br>Comes mix'd with showers; and, fading, leaves behind 
<br>A beauty and a blossom on the mind. 
<br>We do not strain to show that "thus it grows." 
<br>And "hence we learn" what everybody knows: 
<br>But casting idle dogmas (words) aside, 
<br>We paint a villain in his purple pride; 
<br>And tearing down a power, that grew too bold, 
<br>Show---merely what was done in days of old. 
<br>Leaving this image on the soul, we go 
<br>Unto our gentler story touch'd with woe 
<br>(With woe that wantons not, nor wears away 
<br>The heart), and love too perfect for decay. 
<br>But whatsoe'er we do, we will not shame 
<br>Your better feeling, with an idle game 
<br>Of grin and mimicry (a loathsome task); 
<br>Or strip the great Muse of her mighty mask, 
<br>And hoot her from her throne of tears and sighs, 
<br>Until from folly and base jest she dies. 
<br>No; let her life be long, her reign supreme--- 
<br>If but a dream, it is a glorious dream.

<br>
<br>

<br>Dwell then upon our tale; and bear along 
<br>With you, deep thoughts---of love---of bitter wrong--- 
<br>Of freedom---of sad pity---and lust of pow'r. 
<br>The tale is fitted for an after-hour.
