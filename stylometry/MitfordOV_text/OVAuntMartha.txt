            One of the pleasantest habitations I have ever known is an old white house, built at
               right angles, with the pointed roofs and clustered chimneys of Elizabeth’s day,
               covered with roses, vines, and passion-flowers, and parted by a green sloping meadow
               from a straggling picturesque village street. In this charming abode resides a more
               charming family: a gentleman,  “Polite as all his life in courts
                  had been, And good as he the world had never seen;“  two daughters
               full of sweetness and talent; and aunt Martha—the most delightful of old maids! She
               has another appellation, I suppose,—she must have one;—but I scarcely know it: Aunt
               Martha is the name that belongs to her—the name of affection. Such is the universal
               feeling which she inspires, that all her friends, all her acquaintances, (in this
               case the terms are almost synonymous,) speak of her like her own family:—she is every body’s Aunt Martha—and a very charming Aunt Martha she is.
            First of all, she is, as all women should be if they can, remarkably handsome. She
               may be—it is a delicate matter to speak of a lady’s age!—she must be five-and-forty;
               but few beauties of twenty could stand a comparison with her loveliness. It is such a
               fulness of bloom, so luxuriant, so satiating; just tall enough to carry off the
               plumpness which at forty-five is so becoming; a brilliant complexion; curled pouting
               lips! long, clear, bright grey eyes—the colour for expression, that which unites the
               quickness of the black with the softness of the blue; a Roman regularity of feature;
               and a profusion of rich brown hair.—Such is Aunt Martha. Add to this a very gentle
               and pleasant speech, always kind, and generally lively; the sweetest temper; the
               easiest manners; a singular rectitude and singleness of mind; a perfect
               open-heartedness; and a total unconsciousness of all these charms; and you will
               wonder a little that she is Aunt Martha still. I have heard hints of an early
               engagement broken by the fickleness of man;—and there is about her an aversion to
               love in one particular direction—the love matrimonial—and an overflowing of affection
               in all other channels, that it seems as if the natural course of the stream had been
               violently dammed up. She has many lovers—admirers I should say,—for there is, amidst
                  her good-humoured gaiety, a coyness that forbids their going farther;
               a modesty almost amounting to shyness, that checks even the laughing girls, who
               sometimes accuse her of stealing away their beaux. I do not think any man on earth
               could tempt her into wed-lock;—it would be a most unpardonable monopoly if any one
               should; an intolerable engrossing of a general blessing; a theft from the whole
               community.
            Her usual home is the white house covered with roses; and her station in the family
               is rather doubtful. She is not the mistress, for her charming nieces are old enough
               to take and to adorn the head of the table; nor the housekeeper, though, as she is
               the only lady of the establishment who wears pockets, those ensigns of authority, the
               keys will sometimes be found, with other strays, in that goodly receptacle: nor a
               guest; her spirit is too active for that lazy post; her real vocation there, and
               every where, seems to be comforting, cheering, welcoming, and spoiling every thing
               that comes in her way; and, above all, nursing and taking care. Of all kind
               employments, these are her favourites. Oh the shawlings, the cloakings, the
               cloggings! the cautions against cold, or heat, or rain, or sun! the remedies for
               diseases not arrived! colds uncaught! incipient tooth-aches! rheumatisms to come! She
               loves nursing so well, that we used to accuse her of inventing maladies for other
               people, that she might have the pleasure of curing them; and when they
               really come—as come they will sometimes in spite of Aunt Martha—what a nurse she is!
               It is worth while to be a little sick to be so attended. All the cousins, and
               cousins’ cousins of her connection, as regularly send for her on the occasion of a
               lying-in, as for the midwife. I suppose she has undergone the ceremony of dandling
               the baby, sitting up with the new mamma, and dispensing the caudle, twenty times at
               least. She is equally important at weddings or funerals. Her humanity is
               inexhaustible. She has an intense feeling of fellowship with her kind, and grieves or
               rejoices in the sufferings or happiness of others with a reality as genuine as it is
               rare.
            Her accomplishments are exactly of this sympathetic order; all calculated to
               administer much to the pleasure of her companions, and nothing to her own importance
               or vanity. She leaves to the sirens, her nieces, the higher enchantments of the
               piano, the harp, and the guitar, and that noblest of instruments, the human voice;
               ambitious of no other musical fame than such as belongs to the playing of quadrilles
               and waltzes for their little dances, in which she is indefatigable: she neither
               caricatures the face of man nor of nature under pretence of drawing figures or
               landscapes; but she ornaments the reticules, bell-ropes, ottomans, and chair-covers
               of all her acquaintance, with flowers as rich and luxuriant as her own beauty. She
               draws patterns for the ignorant, and works flounces, frills, and
               baby-linen, for the idle; she reads aloud to the sick, plays at cards with the old,
               and loses at chess to the unhappy. Her gift in gossiping, too, is extraordinary; she
               is a gentle newsmonger, and turns her scandal on the sunny side. But she is an old
               maid still; and certain small peculiarities hang about her. She is a thorough
               hoarder: whatever fashion comes up, she is sure to have something of the sort by
               her—or, at least, something thereunto convertible. She is a little superstitious;
               sees strangers in her tea-cup, gifts in her finger-nails, letters and winding-sheets
               in the candle, and purses and coffins in the fire; would not spill the salt “for all
               the worlds that one ever has to give;” and looks with dismay on a crossed knife and
               fork. Moreover, she is orderly to fidgetiness;—that is her greatest calamity!—for
               young ladies now-a-days are not quite so tidy as they should be,—and ladies’ maids
               are much worse; and drawers are tumbled, and drawing-rooms in a litter. Happy she to
               whom a disarranged drawer can be a misery! Dear and happy Aunt Martha!

               really come—as come they will sometimes in spite of Aunt Martha—what a nurse she is!
               It is worth while to be a little sick to be so attended. All the cousins, and
               cousins’ cousins of her connection, as regularly send for her on the occasion of a
               lying-in, as for the midwife. I suppose she has undergone the ceremony of dandling
               the baby, sitting up with the new mamma, and dispensing the caudle, twenty times at
               least. She is equally important at weddings or funerals. Her humanity is
               inexhaustible. She has an intense feeling of fellowship with her kind, and grieves or
               rejoices in the sufferings or happiness of others with a reality as genuine as it is
               rare. Her usual home is the white house covered with roses; and her station in the family
               is rather doubtful. She is not the mistress, for her charming nieces are old enough
               to take and to adorn the head of the table; nor the housekeeper, though, as she is
               the only lady of the establishment who wears pockets, those ensigns of authority, the
               keys will sometimes be found, with other strays, in that goodly receptacle: nor a
               guest; her spirit is too active for that lazy post; her real vocation there, and
               every where, seems to be comforting, cheering, welcoming, and spoiling every thing
               that comes in her way; and, above all, nursing and taking care. Of all kind
               employments, these are her favourites. Oh the shawlings, the cloakings, the
               cloggings! the cautions against cold, or heat, or rain, or sun! the remedies for
               diseases not arrived! colds uncaught! incipient tooth-aches! rheumatisms to come! She
               loves nursing so well, that we used to accuse her of inventing maladies for other
               people, that she might have the pleasure   of curing them; and when they
               really come—as come they will sometimes in spite of Aunt Martha—what a nurse she is!

             Her accomplishments are exactly of this sympathetic order; all calculated to
               administer much to the pleasure of her companions, and nothing to her own importance
               or vanity. She leaves to the sirens, her nieces, the higher enchantments of the
               piano, the harp, and the guitar, and that noblest of instruments, the human voice;
               ambitious of no other musical fame than such as belongs to the playing of quadrilles
               and waltzes for their little dances, in which she is indefatigable: she neither
               caricatures the face of man nor of nature under pretence of drawing figures or
               landscapes; but she ornaments the reticules, bell-ropes, ottomans, and chair-covers
               of all her acquaintance, with flowers as rich and luxuriant as her own beauty. She
               draws patterns for the ignorant, and works flounces, frills, and
               baby-linen, for the idle; she reads aloud to the sick, plays at cards with the old,
               and loses at chess to the unhappy. Her gift in gossiping, too, is extraordinary; she
               is a gentle newsmonger, and turns her scandal on the sunny side. But she is an old
               maid still; and certain small peculiarities hang about her. She is a thorough
               hoarder: whatever fashion comes up, she is sure to have something of the sort by
               her—or, at least, something thereunto convertible. She is a little superstitious;
               sees strangers in her tea-cup, gifts in her finger-nails, letters and winding-sheets
               in the candle, and purses and coffins in the fire; would not spill the salt “for all
               the worlds that one ever has to give;” and looks with dismay on a crossed knife and
               fork. Moreover, she is orderly to fidgetiness;—that is her greatest calamity!—for
               young ladies now-a-days are not quite so tidy as they should be,—and ladies’ maids
               are much worse; and drawers are tumbled, and drawing-rooms in a litter. Happy she to
               whom a disarranged drawer can be a misery! Dear and happy Aunt Martha! Her accomplishments are exactly of this sympathetic order; all calculated to
