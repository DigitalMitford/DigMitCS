                These are bad times for farmers.Mitford composed this sketch in
                            April 1822. I am sorry for it.
                    Independently of all questions of policy, as a mere matter of taste and of old
                    association, it was a fine thing to witness the hearty hospitality, and to think
                    of the social happiness of a great farm-house. No situation in life seemed so
                    richly privileged; none had so much power for good and so little for evil; it
                    seemed a place where pride could not live, and poverty could not enter. These
                    thoughts pressed on my mind the other day, in passing the green sheltered lane,
                    overhung with trees like an avenue, that leads to the great farm at
                            M.,In a letter to Sir William
                            Elford of 1816, Mitford mentions the
                        death of her friend Mr. Newell of
                            Whitby Park. While L'Estrange
                        dates this letter as November 24, 1816, it
                        was in fact written on October 20, 1816.
                        Several things argue for Mr. Newell as the original of the farmer in this
                        sketch, notably verbatim passages in this sketch from the Elford letter, as
                        well as strong echoes of situations connected to this man. In addition, the
                        election that Mitford mentions in A Great Farmhouse is reminiscent of the
                        contested 1816 Parliamentary elections. She also refers to Mr. Newell in an
                        unpublished letter to Mary
                            Webb of October 28, 1816, in
                        which she tells of receiving one of his greyhounds upon his death, and to
                        Elford of December 23, 1816, in which she
                        shares an epitaph she wrote for
                        him.

                        places these general recollections around the years 1810 to 1812. I used to spend so
                    many pleasant days. I could not help advancing a few paces up the lane, and then
                    turning to lean over the gate, seemingly gazing on the rich undulating valley,
                    crowned with woody hills, which, as I stood under the dark and shady arch, lay
                    bathed in the sunshine before me, but really absorbed in thoughts of other
                    times, in recollections of the old delights of that delightful
                    place, and of the admirable qualities of its owners. How often I had opened that
                    gate, and how gaily—certain of meeting a smiling welcome—and what a picture of
                    comfort it was!
                Passing up the lane, we used first to encounter a thick solid suburb of ricks, of all sorts, shapes, and dimensions. Then came the farm, like a town; a magnificent series of buildings, stables, cart-houses, cow-houses, granaries, and barns, that might hold half the corn of the parish, placed at all angles towards each other, and mixed with smaller habitations for pigs, dogs, and poultry. They formed, together with the old substantial farm-house, a sort of amphitheatre, looking over a beautiful meadow, which swept greenly and abruptly down into fertile inclosures, richly set with hedge-row timber, oak, and ash, and elm. Both the meadow and the farm-yard swarmed with inhabitants of the earth and of the air; horses, oxen, cows, calves, heifers, sheep, and pigs; beautiful greyhounds, all manner of poultry, a tame goat, and a pet donkey.
                The master of this land of
                        plenty was well fitted to preside over it; a thick, stout man, of
                    middle height, and middle age, with a healthy, ruddy, square face, all alive
                    with intelligence and good-humour. There was a lurking jest in his eye, and a
                    smile about the corners of his firmly-closed lips, that gave assurance of good
                    fellowship. His voice was loud enough to have hailed a ship at sea,
                    without the assistance of a speaking-trumpet,The foregoing
                        sentence is found verbatim in Mitford's October 20,

                            Elford, in which she informs him of Mr. Newell's death. wonderfully rich
                    and round in its tones, and harmonizing admirably with his bluff, jovial visage.
                    He wore his dark shining hair combed straight over his forehead, and had a
                    trick, when particularly merry, of stroking it down with his hand. The moment
                    his right hand approached his head, out flew a jest.
                Besides his own great farm, the business of which seemed to go on like machinery,
                    always regular, prosperous, and unfailing,—besides this and two or three
                    constant stewardships, and a perpetual succession of arbitrations, in which,
                    such was the influence of his acuteness, his temper, and his sturdy justice,
                    that he was often named by both parties, and left to decide alone,—in addition
                    to these occupations, he was a sort of standing overseer and
                    church-warden; he ruled his own hamlet like a despotic monarch, and took a prime minister’s
                    share in the government of the large parish to which it was attached; and one of
                    the gentlemen, whose estates
                    he managed, being the independent member of an independent borough, he had every
                    now and then a contested election on his
                    shoulders.
                    Even that did not discompose him. He had always leisure to receive his friends
                    at home, or to visit them abroad; to take journeys to London, or make excursions to the sea-side;
                    was as punctual in pleasure as in business, and thought being happy
                    and making happy as much the purpose of his life as getting rich. His great
                    amusement was coursing. He kept several brace of capital greyhounds, so high-blooded, that I remember when five
                    of them were confined in five different kennels on account of their ferocity.
                    The greatest of living painters once called a greyhound, “the line of beauty in perpetual motion.”
                    Our friend’s large dogs were
                    a fine illustration of this remark. His old dog, Hector, for instance,
                    for whom he refused a hundred guineas,—what a superb dog was <rs
                    type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet_OV">Hector</rs>!—a model of grace and
                    symmetry, necked and crested like an <rs type="animal"
                    ref="Arabian_horse">Arabian</rs>, and bearing himself with a stateliness and
                    gallantry that showed some “conscience of his
                    worth.”
                    He was the largest dog I ever saw;
                    but so finely proportioned, that the most determined fault-finder could call him
                    neither too long nor too heavy. There was not an inch too much of him. His
                    colour was the purest white, entirely unspotted, except that his head was very
                    regularly and richly marked with black. Hector was certainly a perfect beauty. But the little bitches, on which his master piqued himself still more,
                    were not in my poor judgment so admirable. They were pretty little round,
                    graceful things, sleek and glossy, and for the most part milk-white, with the
                    smallest heads, and the most dove-like eyes that were ever seen. There was a peculiar sort of innocent beauty about them, like that of a
                    roly-poly child. They were as gentle as lambs too: all the evil spirit of the
                    family evaporated in the gentlemen. But, to my thinking, these pretty creatures
                    were fitter for the parlour than the field. They were strong, certainly,
                    excellently loined, cat-footed, and chested like a war-horse; but there was a
                    want of length about them—a want of room, as the coursers say; something a
                    little, a very little inclining to the clumsy; a dumpiness, a pointer-look. They
                    went off like an arrow from a bow; for the first hundred yards nothing could
                    stand against them; then they began to flag, to find their weight too much for
                    their speed, and to lose ground from the shortness of the stroke. Up-hill,
                    however, they were capital. They turned with the hare, and lost neither wind nor way in the sharpest ascent. I shall
                    never forget one single-handed course of our good friend’s favourite little
                    bitch Helen, on W. Hill. All the coursers were in the valley below, looking up to
                    the hill side as on a moving picture. I suppose she turned the hare twenty times on a piece of greensward not much bigger than an acre, and as steep
                    as the roof of a house. It was an old hare, a
                    famous hare, one that had baffled half the
                        dogs in the county; but she killed him; and
                    then, though almost as large as herself, took it up in her mouth, brought it to
                        her master, and laid it down at his feet. Oh how pleased he was!
                    and what a pleasure it was to see his triumph! He did not always find W. Hill so fortunate. It is a high steep hill, of
                    a conical shape, encircled by a mountain road winding up to the summit like a
                    cork-screw,—a deep road dug out of the chalk, and fenced by high mounds on
                    either side. The hares always make for this
                    hollow way, as it is called, because it is too wide for a leap, and the dogs lose much time in mounting and descending
                    the sharp acclivities. Very eager dogs will
                    sometimes dare the leap, and two of our good friend’s favourite greyhounds perished in the attempt in
                    two following years. They were found dead in the hollow way. After this he took
                    a dislike to distant coursing meetings, and sported chiefly on his own beautiful
                    farm.
                His wife was like her husband, with a difference, as they say in heraldry. Like him in looks, only thinner and paler; like him in voice and phrase, only not so loud; like him in merriment and good-humour; like him in her talent of welcoming and making happy, and being kind; like him in cherishing an abundance of pets, and in getting through with marvellous facility an astounding quantity of business and pleasure. Perhaps the quality in which they resembled each other most completely, was the happy ease and serenity of behaviour, so seldom found amongst people of the middle rank, who have usually a best manner and a worst, and whose best (that is the studied, the company manner) is so very much the worst. She was frankness itself; entirely free from prickly defiance, or bristling self-love. She never took offence or gave it; never thought of herself or of what others would think of her; had never been afflicted with the besetting sins of her station, a dread of the vulgar, or an aspiration after the genteel. Those “words of fear” had never disturbed her delightful heartiness.
                Her pets were her cows, her poultry, her bees, and her flowers; chiefly her poultry, almost as numerous as the bees, and as various as the flowers. The farmyard swarmed with peacocks, turkeys, geese, tame and wild-ducks, fowls, guinea-hens, and pigeons; besides a brood or two of favourite bantams in the green court before the door, with a little ridiculous strutter of a cock at their head, who imitated the magnificent demeanour of the great Tom of the barn-yard, just as Tom in his turn copied the fierce bearing of that warlike and terrible biped the he-turkey. I am the least in the world afraid of a turkey-cock, and used to steer clear of the turkery as often as I could. Commend me to the peaceable vanity of that jewel of a bird the peacock, sweeping his gorgeous tail along the grass, or dropping it gracefully from some low-boughed tree, whilst he turns round his crested head with the air of a birth-day belle, to see who admires him. What a glorious creature it is! How thoroughly content with himself and with all the world!
                Next to her poultry our good farmer’s wife loved her flower-garden; and indeed it was of the very first water, the only thing about the place that was fine. She was a real genuine florist; valued pinks, tulips, and auriculas, for certain qualities of shape and colour, with which beauty has nothing to do; preferred black ranunculuses, and gave into all those obliquities of a triple-refined taste by which the professed florist contrives to keep pace with the vagaries of the Bibliomaniac. Of all odd fashions, that of dark, gloomy, dingy flowers, appears to me the oddest. Your true connoisseur now, shall prefer a deep puce hollyhock, to the gay pink blossoms which cluster round that splendid plant like a pyramid of roses. So did she. The nomenclature of her garden was more distressing still. One is never thoroughly sociable with flowers till they are naturalized as it were, christened, provided with decent, homely, well-wearing English names. Now her plants had all sorts of heathenish appellations, which,—no offence to her learning,—always sounded wrong. I liked the bees’ garden best; the plot of ground immediately round their hives, filled with common flowers for their use, and literally “redolent of sweets.” Bees are insects of great taste in every way, and seem often to se-lect for beauty as much as for flavour. They have a better eye for colour than the florist. The butterfly is also dilettante. Rover though he be, he generally perfers the blossoms that become him best. What a pretty picture it is, in a sunshiny autumn day, to see a bright spotted butterfly, made up of gold and purple and splendid brown, swinging on the rich flower of the china aster!
                To come back to our farm. Within doors every thing went as well as without. There were no fine misses sitting before the piano, and mixing the alloy of their new-fangled tinsel with the old sterling metal; nothing but an only son excellently brought up, a fair slim youth, whose extraordinary and somewhat pensive elegance of mind and manner was thrown into fine relief by his father’s loud hilarity, and harmonised delightfully with the smiling kindness of his mother. His Spensers and Thomsons, too, looked well amongst the hyacinths and geraniums that filled the windows of the little snug room in which they usually sate; a sort of after-thought, built at an angle from the house, and looking into the farm-yard. It was closely packed with favourite arm-chairs, favourite sofas, favourite tables, and a sideboard decorated with the prize-cups and collars of the greyhounds, and generally loaded with substantial work-baskets, jars of flowers, great pyramids of home-made cakes, and sparkling bottles of goose-berry-wine, famous all over the country. The walls were covered with portraits of half a dozen greyhounds, a brace of spaniels, as large as life, an old pony, and the master and mistress of the house in half-length. She as unlike as possible, prim, mincing, delicate, in lace and satin; he so staringly and ridiculously like, that when the picture fixed its good-humoured eyes upon you as you entered the room, you were almost tempted to say—How d’ye do?—Alas! the portraits are now gone, and the originals. Death and distance have despoiled that pleasant home. The garden has lost its smiling mistress; the greyhounds their kind master; and new people, new manners, and new cares, have taken possession of the old abode of peace and plenty—the great farm-house.
        
         
             
                A GREAT FARM-HOUSE.
                These are bad times for farmers.Mitford composed this sketch in
                            April 1822. I am sorry for it.
                    Independently of all questions of policy, as a mere matter of taste and of old

                    of the social happiness of a great farm-house. No situation in life seemed so
                    richly privileged; none had so much power for good and so little for evil; it
                    seemed a place where pride could not live, and poverty could not enter. These
                    thoughts pressed on my mind the other day, in passing the green sheltered lane,

                            Whitby Park. While L'Estrange
                        dates this letter as November 24, 1816, it
                        was in fact written on October 20, 1816.
                        Several things argue for Mr. Newell as the original of the farmer in this
                        sketch, notably verbatim passages in this sketch from the Elford letter, as
                        well as strong echoes of situations connected to this man. In addition, the
                        election that Mitford mentions in A Great Farmhouse is reminiscent of the
                        contested 1816 Parliamentary elections. She also refers to Mr. Newell in an
                        unpublished letter to Mary

                    church-warden; he ruled his own hamlet like a despotic monarch, and took a prime minister’s
                    share in the government of the large parish to which it was attached; and one of
                    the gentlemen, whose estates
                    he managed, being the independent member of an independent borough, he had every
                    now and then a contested election on his
                    shoulders.
                    Even that did not discompose him. He had always leisure to receive his friends
                    at home, or to visit them abroad; to take journeys to London, or make excursions to the sea-side;
                    was as punctual in pleasure as in business, and thought being happy
                    and making happy as much the purpose of his life as getting rich. His great
                    amusement was coursing. He kept several brace of capital greyhounds, so high-blooded, that I remember when five
                    of them were confined in five different kennels on account of their ferocity.
                    The greatest of living painters once called a greyhound, “the line of beauty in perpetual motion.”
                    Our friend’s large dogs were
                    a fine illustration of this remark. His old dog, Hector, for instance,
                    for whom he refused a hundred guineas,—what a superb dog was <rs
                    type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet_OV">Hector</rs>!—a model of grace and
                    symmetry, necked and crested like an <rs type="animal"
                    ref="Arabian_horse">Arabian</rs>, and bearing himself with a stateliness and
                    gallantry that showed some “conscience of his
                    worth.”
                    He was the largest dog I ever saw;
                    but so finely proportioned, that the most determined fault-finder could call him
                    neither too long nor too heavy. There was not an inch too much of him. His
                    colour was the purest white, entirely unspotted, except that his head was very
                    regularly and richly marked with black. Hector was certainly a perfect beauty. But the little bitches, on which his master piqued himself still more,
                    were not in my poor judgment so admirable. They were pretty little round,
                    graceful things, sleek and glossy, and for the most part milk-white, with the
                    smallest heads, and the most dove-like eyes that were ever seen. There was a peculiar sort of innocent beauty about them, like that of a
                    roly-poly child. They were as gentle as lambs too: all the evil spirit of the
                    family evaporated in the gentlemen. But, to my thinking, these pretty creatures
                    were fitter for the parlour than the field. They were strong, certainly,
                    excellently loined, cat-footed, and chested like a war-horse; but there was a
                    want of length about them—a want of room, as the coursers say; something a
                    little, a very little inclining to the clumsy; a dumpiness, a pointer-look. They
                    went off like an arrow from a bow; for the first hundred yards nothing could
                    stand against them; then they began to flag, to find their weight too much for
                    their speed, and to lose ground from the shortness of the stroke. Up-hill,
                    however, they were capital. They turned with the hare, and lost neither wind nor way in the sharpest ascent. I shall
                    never forget one single-handed course of our good friend’s favourite little
                    bitch Helen, on W. Hill. All the coursers were in the valley below, looking up to
                    the hill side as on a moving picture. I suppose she turned the hare twenty times on a piece of greensward not much bigger than an acre, and as steep
                    as the roof of a house. It was an old hare, a
                    famous hare, one that had baffled half the
                        dogs in the county; but she killed him; and
                    then, though almost as large as herself, took it up in her mouth, brought it to
                        her master, and laid it down at his feet. Oh how pleased he was!
                    and what a pleasure it was to see his triumph! He did not always find W. Hill so fortunate. It is a high steep hill, of
                    a conical shape, encircled by a mountain road winding up to the summit like a
                    cork-screw,—a deep road dug out of the chalk, and fenced by high mounds on
                    either side. The hares always make for this
                    hollow way, as it is called, because it is too wide for a leap, and the dogs lose much time in mounting and descending
                    the sharp acclivities. Very eager dogs will
                    sometimes dare the leap, and two of our good friend’s favourite greyhounds perished in the attempt in
                    two following years. They were found dead in the hollow way. After this he took
                    a dislike to distant coursing meetings, and sported chiefly on his own beautiful
                    farm.
                His wife was like her husband, with a difference, as they say in heraldry. Like him in looks, only thinner and paler; like him in voice and phrase, only not so loud; like him in merriment and good-humour; like him in her talent of welcoming and making happy, and being kind; like him in cherishing an abundance of pets, and in getting through with marvellous facility an astounding quantity of business and pleasure. Perhaps the quality in which they resembled each other most completely, was the happy ease and serenity of behaviour, so seldom found amongst people of the middle rank, who have usually a best manner and a worst, and whose best (that is the studied, the company manner) is so very much the worst. She was frankness itself; entirely free from prickly defiance, or bristling self-love. She never took offence or gave it; never thought of herself or of what others would think of her; had never been afflicted with the besetting sins of her station, a dread of the vulgar, or an aspiration after the genteel. Those “words of fear” had never disturbed her delightful heartiness.
                Her pets were her cows, her poultry, her bees, and her flowers; chiefly her poultry, almost as numerous as the bees, and as various as the flowers. The farmyard swarmed with peacocks, turkeys, geese, tame and wild-ducks, fowls, guinea-hens, and pigeons; besides a brood or two of favourite bantams in the green court before the door, with a little ridiculous strutter of a cock at their head, who imitated the magnificent demeanour of the great Tom of the barn-yard, just as Tom in his turn copied the fierce bearing of that warlike and terrible biped the he-turkey. I am the least in the world afraid of a turkey-cock, and used to steer clear of the turkery as often as I could. Commend me to the peaceable vanity of that jewel of a bird the peacock, sweeping his gorgeous tail along the grass, or dropping it gracefully from some low-boughed tree, whilst he turns round his crested head with the air of a birth-day belle, to see who admires him. What a glorious creature it is! How thoroughly content with himself and with all the world!
                Next to her poultry our good farmer’s wife loved her flower-garden; and indeed it was of the very first water, the only thing about the place that was fine. She was a real genuine florist; valued pinks, tulips, and auriculas, for certain qualities of shape and colour, with which beauty has nothing to do; preferred black ranunculuses, and gave into all those obliquities of a triple-refined taste by which the professed florist contrives to keep pace with the vagaries of the Bibliomaniac. Of all odd fashions, that of dark, gloomy, dingy flowers, appears to me the oddest. Your true connoisseur now, shall prefer a deep puce hollyhock, to the gay pink blossoms which cluster round that splendid plant like a pyramid of roses. So did she. The nomenclature of her garden was more distressing still. One is never thoroughly sociable with flowers till they are naturalized as it were, christened, provided with decent, homely, well-wearing English names. Now her plants had all sorts of heathenish appellations, which,—no offence to her learning,—always sounded wrong. I liked the bees’ garden best; the plot of ground immediately round their hives, filled with common flowers for their use, and literally “redolent of sweets.” Bees are insects of great taste in every way, and seem often to se-lect for beauty as much as for flavour. They have a better eye for colour than the florist. The butterfly is also dilettante. Rover though he be, he generally perfers the blossoms that become him best. What a pretty picture it is, in a sunshiny autumn day, to see a bright spotted butterfly, made up of gold and purple and splendid brown, swinging on the rich flower of the china aster!
                To come back to our farm. Within doors every thing went as well as without. There were no fine misses sitting before the piano, and mixing the alloy of their new-fangled tinsel with the old sterling metal; nothing but an only son excellently brought up, a fair slim youth, whose extraordinary and somewhat pensive elegance of mind and manner was thrown into fine relief by his father’s loud hilarity, and harmonised delightfully with the smiling kindness of his mother. His Spensers and Thomsons, too, looked well amongst the hyacinths and geraniums that filled the windows of the little snug room in which they usually sate; a sort of after-thought, built at an angle from the house, and looking into the farm-yard. It was closely packed with favourite arm-chairs, favourite sofas, favourite tables, and a sideboard decorated with the prize-cups and collars of the greyhounds, and generally loaded with substantial work-baskets, jars of flowers, great pyramids of home-made cakes, and sparkling bottles of goose-berry-wine, famous all over the country. The walls were covered with portraits of half a dozen greyhounds, a brace of spaniels, as large as life, an old pony, and the master and mistress of the house in half-length. She as unlike as possible, prim, mincing, delicate, in lace and satin; he so staringly and ridiculously like, that when the picture fixed its good-humoured eyes upon you as you entered the room, you were almost tempted to say—How d’ye do?—Alas! the portraits are now gone, and the originals. Death and distance have despoiled that pleasant home. The garden has lost its smiling mistress; the greyhounds their kind master; and new people, new manners, and new cares, have taken possession of the old abode of peace and plenty—the great farm-house.

                 Passing up the lane, we used first to encounter a thick solid suburb of ricks, of all sorts, shapes, and dimensions. Then came the farm, like a town; a magnificent series of buildings, stables, cart-houses, cow-houses, granaries, and barns, that might hold half the corn of the parish, placed at all angles towards each other, and mixed with smaller habitations for pigs, dogs, and poultry. They formed, together with the old substantial farm-house, a sort of amphitheatre, looking over a beautiful meadow, which swept greenly and abruptly down into fertile inclosures, richly set with hedge-row timber, oak, and ash, and elm. Both the meadow and the farm-yard swarmed with inhabitants of the earth and of the air; horses, oxen, cows, calves, heifers, sheep, and pigs; beautiful greyhounds, all manner of poultry, a tame goat, and a pet donkey.

                    constant stewardships, and a perpetual succession of arbitrations, in which,
                    such was the influence of his acuteness, his temper, and his sturdy justice,
                    that he was often named by both parties, and left to decide alone,—in addition
                    to these occupations, he was a sort of standing overseer and
                    church-warden; he ruled his own hamlet like a despotic monarch, and took a prime minister’s
                    share in the government of the large parish to which it was attached; and one of
                    the gentlemen, whose estates
                    he managed, being the independent member of an independent borough, he had every
                    now and then a contested election on his
                    shoulders.
                    Even that did not discompose him. He had always leisure to receive his friends
                    at home, or to visit them abroad; to take journeys to London, or make excursions to the sea-side;
                    was as punctual in pleasure as in business, and thought being happy
                    and making happy as much the purpose of his life as getting rich. His great
                    amusement was coursing. He kept several brace of capital greyhounds, so high-blooded, that I remember when five
                    of them were confined in five different kennels on account of their ferocity.
                    The greatest of living painters once called a greyhound, “the line of beauty in perpetual motion.”
                    Our friend’s large dogs were
                    a fine illustration of this remark. His old dog, Hector, for instance,
                    for whom he refused a hundred guineas,—what a superb dog was <rs
                    type="animal" ref="#Hector_pet_OV">Hector</rs>!—a model of grace and
                    symmetry, necked and crested like an <rs type="animal"
                    ref="Arabian_horse">Arabian</rs>, and bearing himself with a stateliness and
                    gallantry that showed some “conscience of his
                    worth.”
                    He was the largest dog I ever saw;
                    but so finely proportioned, that the most determined fault-finder could call him
                    neither too long nor too heavy. There was not an inch too much of him. His
                    colour was the purest white, entirely unspotted, except that his head was very
                    regularly and richly marked with black. Hector was certainly a perfect beauty. But the little bitches, on which his master piqued himself still more,
                    were not in my poor judgment so admirable. They were pretty little round,
                    graceful things, sleek and glossy, and for the most part milk-white, with the
                    smallest heads, and the most dove-like eyes that were ever seen. There was a peculiar sort of innocent beauty about them, like that of a
                    roly-poly child. They were as gentle as lambs too: all the evil spirit of the
                    family evaporated in the gentlemen. But, to my thinking, these pretty creatures
                    were fitter for the parlour than the field. They were strong, certainly,
                    excellently loined, cat-footed, and chested like a war-horse; but there was a
                    want of length about them—a want of room, as the coursers say; something a
                    little, a very little inclining to the clumsy; a dumpiness, a pointer-look. They
                    went off like an arrow from a bow; for the first hundred yards nothing could
                    stand against them; then they began to flag, to find their weight too much for
                    their speed, and to lose ground from the shortness of the stroke. Up-hill,
                    however, they were capital. They turned with the hare, and lost neither wind nor way in the sharpest ascent. I shall
                    never forget one single-handed course of our good friend’s favourite little
                    bitch Helen, on W. Hill. All the coursers were in the valley below, looking up to
                    the hill side as on a moving picture. I suppose she turned the hare twenty times on a piece of greensward not much bigger than an acre, and as steep
                    as the roof of a house. It was an old hare, a
                    famous hare, one that had baffled half the
                        dogs in the county; but she killed him; and
                    then, though almost as large as herself, took it up in her mouth, brought it to
                        her master, and laid it down at his feet. Oh how pleased he was!
                    and what a pleasure it was to see his triumph! He did not always find W. Hill so fortunate. It is a high steep hill, of
                    a conical shape, encircled by a mountain road winding up to the summit like a
                    cork-screw,—a deep road dug out of the chalk, and fenced by high mounds on
                    either side. The hares always make for this
                    hollow way, as it is called, because it is too wide for a leap, and the dogs lose much time in mounting and descending
                    the sharp acclivities. Very eager dogs will
                    sometimes dare the leap, and two of our good friend’s favourite greyhounds perished in the attempt in
                    two following years. They were found dead in the hollow way. After this he took
                    a dislike to distant coursing meetings, and sported chiefly on his own beautiful
                    farm. Besides his own great farm, the business of which seemed to go on like machinery,

He is said to have frequently coursed greyhounds, and speaks to MRM about them in letters, though I didn't find any such quotes in his published works.

                 His wife was like her husband, with a difference, as they say in heraldry. Like him in looks, only thinner and paler; like him in voice and phrase, only not so loud; like him in merriment and good-humour; like him in her talent of welcoming and making happy, and being kind; like him in cherishing an abundance of pets, and in getting through with marvellous facility an astounding quantity of business and pleasure. Perhaps the quality in which they resembled each other most completely, was the happy ease and serenity of behaviour, so seldom found amongst people of the middle rank, who have usually a best manner and a worst, and whose best (that is the studied, the company manner) is so very much the worst. She was frankness itself; entirely free from prickly defiance, or bristling self-love. She never took offence or gave it; never thought of herself or of what others would think of her; had never been afflicted with the besetting sins of her station, a dread of the vulgar, or an aspiration after the genteel.

The farmyard swarmed with peacocks, turkeys, geese, tame and wild-ducks, fowls, guinea-hens, and pigeons; besides a brood or two of favourite bantams in the green court before the door, with a little ridiculous strutter of a cock at their head, who imitated the magnificent demeanour of the great Tom of the barn-yard, just as Tom in his turn copied the fierce bearing of that warlike and terrible biped the he-turkey.

                 Next to her poultry our good farmer’s wife loved her flower-garden; and indeed it was of the very first water, the only thing about the place that was fine. She was a real genuine florist; valued pinks, tulips, and auriculas, for certain qualities of shape and colour, with which beauty has nothing to do; preferred black ranunculuses, and gave into all those obliquities of a triple-refined taste by which the professed florist contrives to keep pace with the vagaries of the Bibliomaniac.

Your true connoisseur now, shall prefer a deep puce hollyhock, to the gay pink blossoms which cluster round that splendid plant like a pyramid of roses. So did she. The nomenclature of her garden was more distressing still. One is never thoroughly sociable with flowers till they are naturalized as it were, christened, provided with decent, homely, well-wearing English names. Now her plants had all sorts of heathenish appellations, which,—no offence to her learning,—always sounded wrong. I liked the bees’ garden best; the plot of ground immediately round their hives, filled with common flowers for their use, and literally “redolent of sweets.” Bees are insects of great taste in every way, and seem often to se-lect for beauty as much as for flavour. They have a better eye for colour than the florist. The butterfly is also dilettante. Rover though he be, he generally perfers the blossoms that become him best. What a pretty picture it is, in a sunshiny autumn day, to see a bright spotted butterfly, made up of gold and purple and splendid brown, swinging on the rich flower of the china aster!

                 To come back to our farm. Within doors every thing went as well as without. There were no fine misses sitting before the piano, and mixing the alloy of their new-fangled tinsel with the old sterling metal; nothing but an only son excellently brought up, a fair slim youth, whose extraordinary and somewhat pensive elegance of mind and manner was thrown into fine relief by his father’s loud hilarity, and harmonised delightfully with the smiling kindness of his mother. His Spensers and Thomsons, too, looked well amongst the hyacinths and geraniums that filled the windows of the little snug room in which they usually sate; a sort of after-thought, built at an angle from the house, and looking into the farm-yard. It was closely packed with favourite arm-chairs, favourite sofas, favourite tables, and a sideboard decorated with the prize-cups and collars of the greyhounds, and generally loaded with substantial work-baskets, jars of flowers, great pyramids of home-made cakes, and sparkling bottles of goose-berry-wine, famous all over the country. The walls were covered with portraits of half a dozen greyhounds, a brace of spaniels, as large as life, an old pony, and the master and mistress of the house in half-length. She as unlike as possible, prim, mincing, delicate, in lace and satin; he so staringly and ridiculously like, that when the picture fixed its good-humoured eyes upon you as you entered the room, you were almost tempted to say—How d’ye do?—Alas! the portraits are now gone, and the originals. Death and distance have despoiled that pleasant home.
