            
                OUR VILLAGE.
                Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most
                    delightful is a little village far
                    in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but
                    of cottages and cottage-like houses, “messuages or tenements,”  as
                    a friend of mine calls such ignoble and non-descript
                    dwellings, with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in
                    our garden; a little world of our own, close-packed
                    and insulated like ants in an ant-hill, or bees in a hive, or
                    sheep in a fold, or nuns in a convent, or sailors in a ship; where we know every one, are known to
                    every one, interested in every one, and authorised to hope that every one feels
                    an interest in us. How pleasant it is to slide into these fine-hearted feelings
                    from the kindly and unconscious influence of habit, and to learn to know and to
                    love the people about us, with all their peculiarities, just as we learn to know
                    and to love the nooks and turns of the shady lanes and
                    sunny commons that we pass every day. Even in books I like
                    a confined locality, and so do the critics when
                    they talk of the unities. Nothing is so tiresome as to be
                    whirled half over Europe at the chariot-wheels of a hero, to go to sleep at Vienna,
                    and awaken at Madrid; it produces a real fatigue, a
                    weariness of spirit. On the other hand, nothing is so delightful as to sit down
                    in a country village in one of Miss Austen’s delicious novels, quite sure before
                    we leave it to become intimate with every spot and every person it contains; or
                    to ramble with Mr. White ** White’s
                        Natural History and Antiquities of
                            Selborne; one of the most fascinating
                        books ever written. I wonder that no naturalist has adopted the same
                        plan.  over his own parish of Selborne, and
                    form a friendship with the fields and
                    coppices, as well as with the birds, mice, and squirrels, who
                    inhabit them; or to sail with Robinson
                        Crusoe to his
                            island, and live there with him and his goats and his man
                    Friday;—how much we dread any
                    new comers, any fresh importation of savage or
                        sailor! we never sympathise for a moment in our hero’s want of company, and are quite grieved when he
                    gets away;—or to be shipwrecked with Ferdinand on that other lovelier island—the island of Prospero, and Miranda, and Caliban, and Ariel, and nobody else, none of Dryden’s exotic inventions;—that is best of all. And a small
                    neighbourhood is as good in sober waking reality as in poetry or prose; a
                        village neighbourhood, such as this Berkshire
                    hamlet in which I write, a long, straggling, winding
                    street at the bottom of a fine eminence, with a road
                    through it, always abounding in carts, horsemen, and
                    carriages, and lately enlivened by a stage-coach from
                        B—— to
                        S——, which passed through about ten days ago, and
                    will I suppose return some time or other. There are coaches of all varieties
                    now-a-days; perhaps this may be intended for a monthly diligence, or a fortnightly
                    fly. Will you walk with me through our
                        village, courteous reader? The journey is not long. We will
                    begin at the lower end, and proceed up the hill.
               The tidy square red cottage on the right hand, with the long well-stocked
                    garden by the side of the road, belongs to a retired publican from a neighbouring town; a substantial person with a comely wife; one who piques
                    himself on independence and idleness, talks politics, reads
                    newspapers, hates the minister, and cries out for
                            reform. He
                    introduced into our peaceful vicinage the rebellious innovation of an
                    illumination on the queen’s acquittal. Remonstrance and persuasion were in
                    vain; he talked of liberty and broken windows—so we all lighted up. Oh! how he
                    shone that night with candles and laurel, and white bows, and gold paper, and a
                    transparency (originally designed for a pockethandkerchief) with
                    a flaming portrait of Her Majesty,
                    hatted and feathered, in red ochre. He had no rival in the village, that we all acknowledged; the
                    very bonfire was less splendid; the little boys reserved
                    their best crackers to be expended in his honour, and he gave them full sixpence
                    more than any one else. He would like an illumination once a month; for it must
                    not be concealed that, in spite of gardening, of newspaper reading, of jaunting
                    about in his little cart, and frequenting both church and
                    meeting,
                    our worthy neighbour begins to feel the weariness of
                    idleness. He hangs over his gate, and tries to entice passengers to stop and
                    chat; he volunteers little jobs all round, smokes cherrytrees to cure the
                    blight, and traces and blows up all the wasp-nests in the parish. I have seen a great many  in our
                            garden to-day, and shall enchant him with the intelligence. He even assists
                        his
                        wife in her sweepings and dustings. Poor man! he is a very
                    respectable person, and would be a very happy one, if he would add a little
                    employment to his dignity. It would be the salt of life to him. 
                Next to his house, though parted from it by another long garden with a
                            yew arbour at
                    the end, is the pretty dwelling of the shoemaker, a pale, sickly-looking, black-haired
                    man, the very model of sober industry. There he sits in his little
                        shop from early morning till late at night. An earthquake would
                    hardly stir him: the illumination did not. He stuck immoveably to his last, from
                    the first gradual lighting up, through the long blaze and the gradual decay,
                    till his large solitary candle was the only light in the place. One cannot
                    conceive any thing more perfect than the contempt which the man of
                        transparencies and the man of shoes must have felt for each other on
                    that evening. There was at least as much vanity in the sturdy industry as in the
                    strenuous idleness, for our shoemaker is a man of substance: he employs three
                    journeymen,
                    two lame, and one a dwarf, so that his shop looks like an hospital; he
                    has purchased the lease of his commodious dwelling, some even say that he has
                    bought it out and out; and he has only one pretty daughter, a light,
                    delicate, fair-haired girl of fourteen, the champion, protectress, and
                    playfellow of every brat under three years old, whom she jumps, dances, dandles,
                    and feeds all day long. She is a very attractive person, is that child-loving
                        girl. I have never seen any one in her station who possessed so
                    thoroughly that undefinable charm, the lady-look. See her on a
                    Sunday in her simplicity and her white frock, and she might pass for an earl’s
                    daughter. She likes flowers, too, and has a
                    profusion of white stocks under her
                    window, as pure and delicate as herself.
                 The first house on the opposite side of the way is the blacksmith’s; a gloomy dwelling,
                    where the sun never seems to shine; dark and smoky within and without, like a
                    forge. The blacksmith is a high officer
                    in our little state, nothing less than a constable;
                    but, alas! alas! when tumults arise, and the constable is called for, he will commonly be found in the
                    thickest of the fray. Lucky would it be for his wife and her eight children if there were no public-house in
                    the land: an inveterate inclination to enter those bewitching doors is Mr. Constable’s only fault.
                Next to this official dwelling is a spruce brick tenement, red, high, and narrow,
                    boasting one above another three sash-windows, the only sash-windows in the
                    village, with a clematis on one side and a
                        rose on the other, tall and narrow
                    like itself. That slender mansion has a fine genteel look. The little parlour
                    seems made for Hogarth’s
                    old maid and her stunted footboy; for tea and
                    card-parties,—it would just hold one table; for the
                    rustle of faded silks, and the splendour of old China; for the delight of four
                    by honours, and a little snug quiet scandal between the deals; for affected
                    gentility and real starvation. This should have been its destiny; but fate has
                    been unpropitious: it belongs to a plump, merry, bustling dame, with four fat, rosy, noisy
                            children, the very essence of vulgarity and plenty. 
                Then comes the village shop, like other village shops,
                    multifarious as a bazaar; a repository for bread, shoes, tea,
                    cheese, tape, ribands, and bacon; for
                    every thing, in short, except the one particular thing which you happen to want
                    at the moment, and will be sure not to find. The people are civil and
                    thriving, and frugal withal; they have let the upper part of their house to
                        two young women (one of them is a
                        pretty blue-eyed girl) who
                    teach little children their A B C, and make caps and gowns
                    for their mamas,—parcel
                    schoolmistress, parcel
                    mantua-maker. I believe they find adorning the body a
                    more profitable vocation than adorning the mind.
                    
                    Divided from the shop by a narrow yard, and opposite the
                        shoemaker’s, is a habitation of whose
                    inmates I shall say nothing. A cottage—no—a miniature house, with many
                    additions, little odds and ends of places, pantries, and what not; all angles,
                    and of a charming in-and-outness; a little bricked court before one half, and a
                    little flower-yard before the other; the walls, old and weather-stained, covered
                    with hollyhocks,
                    roses,
                    honeysuckles, and a great apricot-tree; the casements full of geraniums; (ah, there is our superb white cat peeping
                    out from amongst them!) the closets (our landlord has the assurance to call them rooms)
                    full of contrivances and corner-cupboards; and the little garden behind full of
                    common flowers,
                    tulips,
                    pinks,
                    larkspurs,
                    pionies,
                    stocks, and carnations, with an arbour of privet, not unlike a sentry-box, where one
                    lives in a delicious green light, and looks out on the gayest of all gay flower-beds. That house was built on
                    purpose to show in what an exceedingly small compasscomfort may be
                    packed. Well, I will loiter there no longer. 
                The next tenement is a place of importance, the
                    Rose inn; a white-washed
                        building, retired from the road behind its fine swinging sign, with a
                    little bow-window room coming out on one side, and forming, with our
                        stable on the other, a sort of open square, which is
                    the constant resort of carts,
                    waggons, and return chaises. There
                    are two carts there now, and mine
                        host is serving them with beer in his eternal red
                    waistcoat. He is a thriving man, and a portly, as his waistcoat attests, which
                    has been twice let our within this twelvemonth. Our
                    landlord has a stirring wife, a
                    hopeful son, and a daughter, the
                        belle of the village; not so pretty as the
                        fair nymph of the shoe-shop, and far less elegant, but
                    ten times as fine; all curlpapers in the morning, like a porcupine, all curls in the afternoon, like a
                         poodle, with more flounces than curlpapers, and more lovers than
                    curls. Miss Phoebe is fitter for
                        town than country; and, to do
                    her justice, she has a consciousness of that fitness, and turns her steps
                        town-ward as often as she can. She is gone to
                        B—— to-day with her last and principal lover, a
                        recruiting serjeant—a man as tall as Serjeant
                            Kite, and as impudent. Some day or other he will carry off
                        Miss Phoebe.
                In a line with the bow-window room is a low garden-wall, belonging to a house
                    under repair:—the white house opposite the
                    collar-maker’s shop, with four
                        lime-trees before it, and a
                        waggon-load of bricks at the door. That house is the plaything of a
                    wealthy, well-meaning, whimsical person, who lives about
                    a mile off. He has a passion for brick and mortar, and, being too wise to meddle
                    with his own residence, diverts himself with altering and re-altering, improving
                    and re-improving, doing and undoing here. It is a perfect
                    Penelope’s web.
                    Carpenters and
                    bricklayers have been at work
                    for these eighteen months, and yet I sometimes stand and wonder whether any
                    thing has really been done. One exploit in last June was, however, by no means
                    equivocal. Our good neighbour fancied that the limes shaded the rooms, and made them dark, (there was not
                    a creature in the house but the workmen,) so he had all the
                    leaves stripped from every tree. There they stood, poor
                    miserable skeletons, as bare as Christmas under the glowing midsummer sun.
                    Nature revenged herself in her own sweet and gracious manner; fresh leaves
                    sprang out, and at nearly Christmas the foliage was as brilliant as when the
                    outrage was committed.
                Next door lives a carpenter,
                    “famed ten miles round, and worthy all his fame;” few
                        cabinet-makers surpass him, with his
                    excellent wife, and their little daughter
                    Lizzy, the plaything and queen of the village, a child
                    three years old according to the register, but six in size and strength and
                    intellect, in power and in self-will. She manages every body in the
                    place, her school-mistress included; turns the
                        wheeler’s children out of their own little cart, and
                    makes them draw her; seduces cakes and lollypops from the very
                    shop window; makes the lazy carry her, the silent talk to
                    her, the grave romp with her; does any thing she pleases; is absolutely
                    irresistible. Her chief attraction lies in her exceeding power of loving, and
                    her firm reliance on the love and indulgence of others. How impossible it would
                    be to disappoint the dear little girl when she runs to meet you, slides her
                    pretty hand into yours, looks up gladly in your face, and says, “Come!” You must
                    go: you cannot help it. Another part of the charm is her singular beauty.
                    Together with a good deal of the character of Napoleon, she has something of his square, sturdy, upright form,
                    with the finest limbs in the world, a complexion purely English, a round
                    laughing face, sunburnt and rosy, large merry blue eyes, curling brown hair, and a
                    wonderful play of countenance. She has the imperial attitudes too, and loves to
                    stand with her hands behind her, or folded over her bosom; and sometimes, when
                    she has a little touch of shyness, she clasps them together on the top of her
                    head, pressing down her shining curls, and looking so exquisitely pretty! Yes,
                    Lizzy is queen of the village! She has but one rival in
                    her dominions, a certain white greyhound called May-flower,
                    much her friend, who resembles her in beauty and strength, in
                    playfulness, and almost in sagacity, and reigns over the animal world as she
                    over the human. They are both coming with me, Lizzy and
                    Lizzy’s “pretty May.” We are now at the end
                    of the street; a cross lane, a
                    rope-walk, shaded with limes and
                    oaks, and a cool clear pond
                    overhung with elms, lead us to the bottom of the
                    hill. There is still one house
                        round the corner, ending in a picturesque
                    wheeler’s shop. The
                        dwelling-house is more ambitious. Look at the fine
                    flowered window-blinds, the green door with the brass knocker, and the somewhat
                    prim but very civil person, who is sending off a
                        labouring man with sirs and curtsies enough for a
                    prince of the blood. Those are the
                    curate’s lodgings—apartments
                    his landlady would call them: he lives with his
                        own family four miles off, but once or twice a week he comes to
                    his neat little parlour to write sermons,
                    to marry, or to bury, as the case may
                    require. Never were better or kinder people than his host
                    and hostess; and there is a fine reflection of clerical
                    importance about them, since their connexion with the
                    Church, which is quite edifying—a decorum, a gravity, a
                    solemn politeness. Oh, to see the worthy wheeler carry the
                    gown after his lodger on a Sunday, nicely pinned up in his
                        wife’s best handkerchief!—or to hear him rebuke a
                    squalling child or a squabbling woman!
                    The curate is nothing to him. He is fit to be perpetual
                    churchwarden.
                
                We must now cross the lane into the shady rope-walk. That
                        pretty white cottage opposite, which stands
                    straggling at the end of the village in a
                    garden full of flowers, belongs
                    to our mason, the shortest of men, and his
                    handsome, tall wife: he a dwarf, with the voice of a giant; one
                    starts when he begins to talk as if he were shouting through a speaking trumpet;
                    she, the sister,
                    daughter, and grand-daughter, of a
                    long line of gardeners, and no contemptible one herself. It
                    is very magnanimous in me not to hate her; for she beats me in my own way, in
                    chrysanthemums, and dahlias, and
                    the like gauds. Her plants are sure to live; mine have a
                    sad trick of dying, perhaps because I love them, “not wisely, but too
                        well,” and kill them with over-kindness. Half-way up the
                    hill is another detached cottage, the residence of an
                    officer, and his beautiful family.
                    That eldest boy, who is hanging over the gate, and looking
                    with such intense childish admiration at my Lizzy, might be
                    a model for a Cupid.
                How pleasantly the road winds up the hill, with its broad
                        green borders and hedge-rows so
                    thickly timbered! How finely the evening sun falls on that sandy
                        excavated bank, and touches the 
                            farm-house on the top of the eminence! and how
                    clearly defined and relieved is the figure of the man who
                    is just coming down! It is poor John Evans, the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his wife, and became insane.
                    He was sent to St. Luke’s, and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the workhouse, the pensioner and factotum of the
                    village, amongst whom he divides his services. His mind often wanders, intent on
                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to John
                        Evans, for there is that about him which must be loved; and his
                    unprotectedness, his utter defencelessness, have an irresistible claim on every
                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising cucumbers.
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a
                      melon bed—a melon bed!—fie! What a
                    grand pompous name was that for three melon plants under a
                    hand-light! John Evans is sure that they will succeed. We
                    shall see: as the chancellor said, “I
                        doubt.”
                 We are now on the very brow of the eminence, close to the
                            Hill-house and its
                                beautiful garden. On the outer edge of the
                    paling, hanging over the bank
                    that skirts the road, is an old thorn—such
                    a thorn! The long sprays covered with snowy
                    blossoms, so graceful, so elegant, so lightsome, and
                    yet so rich! There only wants a pool under the thorn to give a still lovelier reflection, quivering and
                    trembling, like a tuft of feathers, whiter and greener than the life, and more
                    prettily mixed with the bright blue sky. There should indeed be a
                    pool; but on the dark grass-plat,
                    under the high bank, which is crowned by that
                        magnificent plume, there is something that does almost as
                        well,—Lizzy and May-flower in the
                    midst of a game at romps, “making a sun-shine in the shady
                        place;”
                    Lizzy rolling, laughing, clapping her hands, and glowing
                    like a rose;
                    May-flower playing about her like summer lightning,
                    dazzling the eyes with her sudden turns, her leaps, her bounds, her attacks and
                    her escapes. She darts round the lovely little girl, with
                    the same momentary touch that the swallow skims over the
                    water, and has exactly the same power of flight, the same matchless ease and
                    strength and grace. What a pretty picture they would make; what a pretty
                    foreground they do make to the real landscape! The road winding down the
                        hill with a slight bend, like that in the
                    High-street at Oxford; a
                     waggon slowly ascending, and a
                        horseman cantering up at full speed—(ah!
                    Lizzy,
                    May-flower will certainly desert you to have a gambol with
                    that blood-horse!) half-way down, just at the turn, the
                        red cottage of the lieutenant, covered with vines,
                    the very image of comfort and content; farther down, on the opposite side, the
                        small white dwelling of the little
                    mason; then the limes and the
                    rope-walk; then the village
                        street, peeping through the trees, whose
                    clustering tops hide all but the chimneys and various roofs of the houses, and
                    here and there some angle of a wall: farther on, the elegant town of
                    B——, with its fine old
                    church-towers and spires; the whole view shut in by a range of
                    chalky hills; and over every part of the picture trees, so profusely scattered, that it appears like a
                    woodland scene, with glades and
                        villages intermixed. The trees
                    are of all kinds and all hues, chiefly the finely-shaped elm, of so deep and bright a green, the tips of whose high outer
                    branches drop down with such a crisp and garland-like richness, and the oak, whose stately form is just now so splendidly adorned
                    by the sunny colouring of the young leaves. Turning again up the
                    hill, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm of
                    English scenery, a green common, divided by the road; the
                    right side fringed by hedge-rows and trees, with cottages and 
                        farm-houses irregularly placed, and terminated by a double avenue of
                            noble oaks; the left, prettier still, dappled by bright
                    pools of water, and islands of 
                    cottages and cottage-gardens, and sinking
                    gradually down to corn-fields and
                    meadows, and an old
                        farm-house, with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys, looking outfrom its blooming orchard, and backed by
                    woody hills. The common is itself
                    the prettiest part of the prospect; half covered with low furze, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of
                    the setting sun, and alive with cows and 
                        sheep, and two sets of cricketers: one
                    of young men, surrounded with
                    spectators, some standing, some sitting, some stretched
                    on the grass, all taking a delighted interest in the game;
                    the other, a merry groupe of little boys, at humble
                    distance, for whom even cricket is scarcely lively enough, shouting,
                    leaping, and enjoying themselves to their hearts’ content. But
                        cricketers and country boys are too
                    important persons in our village to be talked of merely
                    as figures in the landscape. They deserve an individual introduction—an essay to
                    themselves—and they shall have it. No fear of forgetting the good-humoured faces
                    that meet us in our walks every day.
            
         
             
                OUR VILLAGE.
                Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most
                    delightful is a little village far
                    in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but
                    of cottages and cottage-like houses, “messuages or tenements,”  as
                    a friend of mine calls such ignoble and non-descript
                    dwellings, with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in
                    our garden; a little world of our own, close-packed
                    and insulated like ants in an ant-hill, or bees in a hive, or
                    sheep in a fold, or nuns in a convent, or sailors in a ship; where we know every one, are known to
                    every one, interested in every one, and authorised to hope that every one feels
                    an interest in us. How pleasant it is to slide into these fine-hearted feelings
                    from the kindly and unconscious influence of habit, and to learn to know and to
                    love the people about us, with all their peculiarities, just as we learn to know
                    and to love the nooks and turns of the shady lanes and
                    sunny commons that we pass every day. Even in books I like
                    a confined locality, and so do the critics when
                    they talk of the unities. Nothing is so tiresome as to be
                    whirled half over Europe at the chariot-wheels of a hero, to go to sleep at Vienna,
                    and awaken at Madrid; it produces a real fatigue, a
                    weariness of spirit. On the other hand, nothing is so delightful as to sit down
                    in a country village in one of Miss Austen’s delicious novels, quite sure before
                    we leave it to become intimate with every spot and every person it contains; or
                    to ramble with Mr. White ** White’s
                        Natural History and Antiquities of
                            Selborne; one of the most fascinating
                        books ever written. I wonder that no naturalist has adopted the same
                        plan.  over his own parish of Selborne, and
                    form a friendship with the fields and
                    coppices, as well as with the birds, mice, and squirrels, who
                    inhabit them; or to sail with Robinson
                        Crusoe to his
                            island, and live there with him and his goats and his man
                    Friday;—how much we dread any
                    new comers, any fresh importation of savage or
                        sailor! we never sympathise for a moment in our hero’s want of company, and are quite grieved when he
                    gets away;—or to be shipwrecked with Ferdinand on that other lovelier island—the island of Prospero, and Miranda, and Caliban, and Ariel, and nobody else, none of Dryden’s exotic inventions;—that is best of all. And a small
                    neighbourhood is as good in sober waking reality as in poetry or prose; a
                        village neighbourhood, such as this Berkshire
                    hamlet in which I write, a long, straggling, winding
                    street at the bottom of a fine eminence, with a road
                    through it, always abounding in carts, horsemen, and
                    carriages, and lately enlivened by a stage-coach from
                        B—— to
                        S——, which passed through about ten days ago, and
                    will I suppose return some time or other. There are coaches of all varieties
                    now-a-days; perhaps this may be intended for a monthly diligence, or a fortnightly
                    fly. Will you walk with me through our
                        village, courteous reader? The journey is not long. We will
                    begin at the lower end, and proceed up the hill.
               The tidy square red cottage on the right hand, with the long well-stocked
                    garden by the side of the road, belongs to a retired publican from a neighbouring town; a substantial person with a comely wife; one who piques
                    himself on independence and idleness, talks politics, reads
                    newspapers, hates the minister, and cries out for
                            reform. He
                    introduced into our peaceful vicinage the rebellious innovation of an
                    illumination on the queen’s acquittal. Remonstrance and persuasion were in
                    vain; he talked of liberty and broken windows—so we all lighted up. Oh! how he
                    shone that night with candles and laurel, and white bows, and gold paper, and a
                    transparency (originally designed for a pockethandkerchief) with
                    a flaming portrait of Her Majesty,
                    hatted and feathered, in red ochre. He had no rival in the village, that we all acknowledged; the
                    very bonfire was less splendid; the little boys reserved
                    their best crackers to be expended in his honour, and he gave them full sixpence
                    more than any one else. He would like an illumination once a month; for it must
                    not be concealed that, in spite of gardening, of newspaper reading, of jaunting
                    about in his little cart, and frequenting both church and
                    meeting,
                    our worthy neighbour begins to feel the weariness of
                    idleness. He hangs over his gate, and tries to entice passengers to stop and
                    chat; he volunteers little jobs all round, smokes cherrytrees to cure the
                    blight, and traces and blows up all the wasp-nests in the parish. I have seen a great many  in our
                            garden to-day, and shall enchant him with the intelligence. He even assists
                        his
                        wife in her sweepings and dustings. Poor man! he is a very
                    respectable person, and would be a very happy one, if he would add a little
                    employment to his dignity. It would be the salt of life to him. 
                Next to his house, though parted from it by another long garden with a
                            yew arbour at
                    the end, is the pretty dwelling of the shoemaker, a pale, sickly-looking, black-haired
                    man, the very model of sober industry. There he sits in his little
                        shop from early morning till late at night. An earthquake would
                    hardly stir him: the illumination did not. He stuck immoveably to his last, from
                    the first gradual lighting up, through the long blaze and the gradual decay,
                    till his large solitary candle was the only light in the place. One cannot
                    conceive any thing more perfect than the contempt which the man of
                        transparencies and the man of shoes must have felt for each other on
                    that evening. There was at least as much vanity in the sturdy industry as in the
                    strenuous idleness, for our shoemaker is a man of substance: he employs three
                    journeymen,
                    two lame, and one a dwarf, so that his shop looks like an hospital; he
                    has purchased the lease of his commodious dwelling, some even say that he has
                    bought it out and out; and he has only one pretty daughter, a light,
                    delicate, fair-haired girl of fourteen, the champion, protectress, and
                    playfellow of every brat under three years old, whom she jumps, dances, dandles,
                    and feeds all day long. She is a very attractive person, is that child-loving
                        girl. I have never seen any one in her station who possessed so
                    thoroughly that undefinable charm, the lady-look. See her on a
                    Sunday in her simplicity and her white frock, and she might pass for an earl’s
                    daughter. She likes flowers, too, and has a
                    profusion of white stocks under her
                    window, as pure and delicate as herself.
                 The first house on the opposite side of the way is the blacksmith’s; a gloomy dwelling,
                    where the sun never seems to shine; dark and smoky within and without, like a
                    forge. The blacksmith is a high officer
                    in our little state, nothing less than a constable;
                    but, alas! alas! when tumults arise, and the constable is called for, he will commonly be found in the
                    thickest of the fray. Lucky would it be for his wife and her eight children if there were no public-house in
                    the land: an inveterate inclination to enter those bewitching doors is Mr. Constable’s only fault.
                Next to this official dwelling is a spruce brick tenement, red, high, and narrow,
                    boasting one above another three sash-windows, the only sash-windows in the
                    village, with a clematis on one side and a
                        rose on the other, tall and narrow
                    like itself. That slender mansion has a fine genteel look. The little parlour
                    seems made for Hogarth’s
                    old maid and her stunted footboy; for tea and
                    card-parties,—it would just hold one table; for the
                    rustle of faded silks, and the splendour of old China; for the delight of four
                    by honours, and a little snug quiet scandal between the deals; for affected
                    gentility and real starvation. This should have been its destiny; but fate has
                    been unpropitious: it belongs to a plump, merry, bustling dame, with four fat, rosy, noisy
                            children, the very essence of vulgarity and plenty. 
                Then comes the village shop, like other village shops,
                    multifarious as a bazaar; a repository for bread, shoes, tea,
                    cheese, tape, ribands, and bacon; for
                    every thing, in short, except the one particular thing which you happen to want
                    at the moment, and will be sure not to find. The people are civil and
                    thriving, and frugal withal; they have let the upper part of their house to
                        two young women (one of them is a
                        pretty blue-eyed girl) who
                    teach little children their A B C, and make caps and gowns
                    for their mamas,—parcel
                    schoolmistress, parcel
                    mantua-maker. I believe they find adorning the body a
                    more profitable vocation than adorning the mind.
                    
                    Divided from the shop by a narrow yard, and opposite the
                        shoemaker’s, is a habitation of whose
                    inmates I shall say nothing. A cottage—no—a miniature house, with many
                    additions, little odds and ends of places, pantries, and what not; all angles,
                    and of a charming in-and-outness; a little bricked court before one half, and a
                    little flower-yard before the other; the walls, old and weather-stained, covered
                    with hollyhocks,
                    roses,
                    honeysuckles, and a great apricot-tree; the casements full of geraniums; (ah, there is our superb white cat peeping
                    out from amongst them!) the closets (our landlord has the assurance to call them rooms)
                    full of contrivances and corner-cupboards; and the little garden behind full of
                    common flowers,
                    tulips,
                    pinks,
                    larkspurs,
                    pionies,
                    stocks, and carnations, with an arbour of privet, not unlike a sentry-box, where one
                    lives in a delicious green light, and looks out on the gayest of all gay flower-beds. That house was built on
                    purpose to show in what an exceedingly small compasscomfort may be
                    packed. Well, I will loiter there no longer. 
                The next tenement is a place of importance, the
                    Rose inn; a white-washed
                        building, retired from the road behind its fine swinging sign, with a
                    little bow-window room coming out on one side, and forming, with our
                        stable on the other, a sort of open square, which is
                    the constant resort of carts,
                    waggons, and return chaises. There
                    are two carts there now, and mine
                        host is serving them with beer in his eternal red
                    waistcoat. He is a thriving man, and a portly, as his waistcoat attests, which
                    has been twice let our within this twelvemonth. Our
                    landlord has a stirring wife, a
                    hopeful son, and a daughter, the
                        belle of the village; not so pretty as the
                        fair nymph of the shoe-shop, and far less elegant, but
                    ten times as fine; all curlpapers in the morning, like a porcupine, all curls in the afternoon, like a
                         poodle, with more flounces than curlpapers, and more lovers than
                    curls. Miss Phoebe is fitter for
                        town than country; and, to do
                    her justice, she has a consciousness of that fitness, and turns her steps
                        town-ward as often as she can. She is gone to
                        B—— to-day with her last and principal lover, a
                        recruiting serjeant—a man as tall as Serjeant
                            Kite, and as impudent. Some day or other he will carry off
                        Miss Phoebe.
                In a line with the bow-window room is a low garden-wall, belonging to a house
                    under repair:—the white house opposite the
                    collar-maker’s shop, with four
                        lime-trees before it, and a
                        waggon-load of bricks at the door. That house is the plaything of a
                    wealthy, well-meaning, whimsical person, who lives about
                    a mile off. He has a passion for brick and mortar, and, being too wise to meddle
                    with his own residence, diverts himself with altering and re-altering, improving
                    and re-improving, doing and undoing here. It is a perfect
                    Penelope’s web.
                    Carpenters and
                    bricklayers have been at work
                    for these eighteen months, and yet I sometimes stand and wonder whether any
                    thing has really been done. One exploit in last June was, however, by no means
                    equivocal. Our good neighbour fancied that the limes shaded the rooms, and made them dark, (there was not
                    a creature in the house but the workmen,) so he had all the
                    leaves stripped from every tree. There they stood, poor
                    miserable skeletons, as bare as Christmas under the glowing midsummer sun.
                    Nature revenged herself in her own sweet and gracious manner; fresh leaves
                    sprang out, and at nearly Christmas the foliage was as brilliant as when the
                    outrage was committed.
                Next door lives a carpenter,
                    “famed ten miles round, and worthy all his fame;” few
                        cabinet-makers surpass him, with his
                    excellent wife, and their little daughter
                    Lizzy, the plaything and queen of the village, a child
                    three years old according to the register, but six in size and strength and
                    intellect, in power and in self-will. She manages every body in the
                    place, her school-mistress included; turns the
                        wheeler’s children out of their own little cart, and
                    makes them draw her; seduces cakes and lollypops from the very
                    shop window; makes the lazy carry her, the silent talk to
                    her, the grave romp with her; does any thing she pleases; is absolutely
                    irresistible. Her chief attraction lies in her exceeding power of loving, and
                    her firm reliance on the love and indulgence of others. How impossible it would
                    be to disappoint the dear little girl when she runs to meet you, slides her
                    pretty hand into yours, looks up gladly in your face, and says, “Come!” You must
                    go: you cannot help it. Another part of the charm is her singular beauty.
                    Together with a good deal of the character of Napoleon, she has something of his square, sturdy, upright form,
                    with the finest limbs in the world, a complexion purely English, a round
                    laughing face, sunburnt and rosy, large merry blue eyes, curling brown hair, and a
                    wonderful play of countenance. She has the imperial attitudes too, and loves to
                    stand with her hands behind her, or folded over her bosom; and sometimes, when
                    she has a little touch of shyness, she clasps them together on the top of her
                    head, pressing down her shining curls, and looking so exquisitely pretty! Yes,
                    Lizzy is queen of the village! She has but one rival in
                    her dominions, a certain white greyhound called May-flower,
                    much her friend, who resembles her in beauty and strength, in
                    playfulness, and almost in sagacity, and reigns over the animal world as she
                    over the human. They are both coming with me, Lizzy and
                    Lizzy’s “pretty May.” We are now at the end
                    of the street; a cross lane, a
                    rope-walk, shaded with limes and
                    oaks, and a cool clear pond
                    overhung with elms, lead us to the bottom of the
                    hill. There is still one house
                        round the corner, ending in a picturesque
                    wheeler’s shop. The
                        dwelling-house is more ambitious. Look at the fine
                    flowered window-blinds, the green door with the brass knocker, and the somewhat
                    prim but very civil person, who is sending off a
                        labouring man with sirs and curtsies enough for a
                    prince of the blood. Those are the
                    curate’s lodgings—apartments
                    his landlady would call them: he lives with his
                        own family four miles off, but once or twice a week he comes to
                    his neat little parlour to write sermons,
                    to marry, or to bury, as the case may
                    require. Never were better or kinder people than his host
                    and hostess; and there is a fine reflection of clerical
                    importance about them, since their connexion with the
                    Church, which is quite edifying—a decorum, a gravity, a
                    solemn politeness. Oh, to see the worthy wheeler carry the
                    gown after his lodger on a Sunday, nicely pinned up in his
                        wife’s best handkerchief!—or to hear him rebuke a
                    squalling child or a squabbling woman!
                    The curate is nothing to him. He is fit to be perpetual
                    churchwarden.
                
                We must now cross the lane into the shady rope-walk. That
                        pretty white cottage opposite, which stands
                    straggling at the end of the village in a
                    garden full of flowers, belongs
                    to our mason, the shortest of men, and his
                    handsome, tall wife: he a dwarf, with the voice of a giant; one
                    starts when he begins to talk as if he were shouting through a speaking trumpet;
                    she, the sister,
                    daughter, and grand-daughter, of a
                    long line of gardeners, and no contemptible one herself. It
                    is very magnanimous in me not to hate her; for she beats me in my own way, in
                    chrysanthemums, and dahlias, and
                    the like gauds. Her plants are sure to live; mine have a
                    sad trick of dying, perhaps because I love them, “not wisely, but too
                        well,” and kill them with over-kindness. Half-way up the
                    hill is another detached cottage, the residence of an
                    officer, and his beautiful family.
                    That eldest boy, who is hanging over the gate, and looking
                    with such intense childish admiration at my Lizzy, might be
                    a model for a Cupid.
                How pleasantly the road winds up the hill, with its broad
                        green borders and hedge-rows so
                    thickly timbered! How finely the evening sun falls on that sandy
                        excavated bank, and touches the 
                            farm-house on the top of the eminence! and how
                    clearly defined and relieved is the figure of the man who
                    is just coming down! It is poor John Evans, the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his wife, and became insane.
                    He was sent to St. Luke’s, and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the workhouse, the pensioner and factotum of the
                    village, amongst whom he divides his services. His mind often wanders, intent on
                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to John
                        Evans, for there is that about him which must be loved; and his
                    unprotectedness, his utter defencelessness, have an irresistible claim on every
                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising cucumbers.
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a
                      melon bed—a melon bed!—fie! What a
                    grand pompous name was that for three melon plants under a
                    hand-light! John Evans is sure that they will succeed. We
                    shall see: as the chancellor said, “I
                        doubt.”
                 We are now on the very brow of the eminence, close to the
                            Hill-house and its
                                beautiful garden. On the outer edge of the
                    paling, hanging over the bank
                    that skirts the road, is an old thorn—such
                    a thorn! The long sprays covered with snowy
                    blossoms, so graceful, so elegant, so lightsome, and
                    yet so rich! There only wants a pool under the thorn to give a still lovelier reflection, quivering and
                    trembling, like a tuft of feathers, whiter and greener than the life, and more
                    prettily mixed with the bright blue sky. There should indeed be a
                    pool; but on the dark grass-plat,
                    under the high bank, which is crowned by that
                        magnificent plume, there is something that does almost as
                        well,—Lizzy and May-flower in the
                    midst of a game at romps, “making a sun-shine in the shady
                        place;”
                    Lizzy rolling, laughing, clapping her hands, and glowing
                    like a rose;
                    May-flower playing about her like summer lightning,
                    dazzling the eyes with her sudden turns, her leaps, her bounds, her attacks and
                    her escapes. She darts round the lovely little girl, with
                    the same momentary touch that the swallow skims over the
                    water, and has exactly the same power of flight, the same matchless ease and
                    strength and grace. What a pretty picture they would make; what a pretty
                    foreground they do make to the real landscape! The road winding down the
                        hill with a slight bend, like that in the
                    High-street at Oxford; a
                     waggon slowly ascending, and a
                        horseman cantering up at full speed—(ah!
                    Lizzy,
                    May-flower will certainly desert you to have a gambol with
                    that blood-horse!) half-way down, just at the turn, the
                        red cottage of the lieutenant, covered with vines,
                    the very image of comfort and content; farther down, on the opposite side, the
                        small white dwelling of the little
                    mason; then the limes and the
                    rope-walk; then the village
                        street, peeping through the trees, whose
                    clustering tops hide all but the chimneys and various roofs of the houses, and
                    here and there some angle of a wall: farther on, the elegant town of
                    B——, with its fine old
                    church-towers and spires; the whole view shut in by a range of
                    chalky hills; and over every part of the picture trees, so profusely scattered, that it appears like a
                    woodland scene, with glades and
                        villages intermixed. The trees
                    are of all kinds and all hues, chiefly the finely-shaped elm, of so deep and bright a green, the tips of whose high outer
                    branches drop down with such a crisp and garland-like richness, and the oak, whose stately form is just now so splendidly adorned
                    by the sunny colouring of the young leaves. Turning again up the
                    hill, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm of
                    English scenery, a green common, divided by the road; the
                    right side fringed by hedge-rows and trees, with cottages and 
                        farm-houses irregularly placed, and terminated by a double avenue of
                            noble oaks; the left, prettier still, dappled by bright
                    pools of water, and islands of 
                    cottages and cottage-gardens, and sinking
                    gradually down to corn-fields and
                    meadows, and an old
                        farm-house, with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys, looking outfrom its blooming orchard, and backed by
                    woody hills. The common is itself
                    the prettiest part of the prospect; half covered with low furze, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of
                    the setting sun, and alive with cows and 
                        sheep, and two sets of cricketers: one
                    of young men, surrounded with
                    spectators, some standing, some sitting, some stretched
                    on the grass, all taking a delighted interest in the game;
                    the other, a merry groupe of little boys, at humble
                    distance, for whom even cricket is scarcely lively enough, shouting,
                    leaping, and enjoying themselves to their hearts’ content. But
                        cricketers and country boys are too
                    important persons in our village to be talked of merely
                    as figures in the landscape. They deserve an individual introduction—an essay to
                    themselves—and they shall have it. No fear of forgetting the good-humoured faces
                    that meet us in our walks every day.
             
                 OUR VILLAGE. OUR VILLAGE. 
                 Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most
                    delightful is a little village far
                    in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but
                    of cottages and cottage-like houses, “messuages or tenements,”  as
                    a friend of mine calls such ignoble and non-descript
                    dwellings, with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in
                    our garden; a little world of our own, close-packed
                    and insulated like ants in an ant-hill, or bees in a hive, or
                    sheep in a fold, or nuns in a convent, or sailors in a ship; where we know every one, are known to
                    every one, interested in every one, and authorised to hope that every one feels
                    an interest in us. How pleasant it is to slide into these fine-hearted feelings
                    from the kindly and unconscious influence of habit, and to learn to know and to
                    love the people about us, with all their peculiarities, just as we learn to know
                    and to love the nooks and turns of the shady lanes and
                    sunny commons that we pass every day. Even in books I like
                    a confined locality, and so do the critics when
                    they talk of the unities. Nothing is so tiresome as to be
                    whirled half over Europe at the chariot-wheels of a hero, to go to sleep at Vienna,
                    and awaken at Madrid; it produces a real fatigue, a
                    weariness of spirit. On the other hand, nothing is so delightful as to sit down
                    in a country village in one of Miss Austen’s delicious novels, quite sure before
                    we leave it to become intimate with every spot and every person it contains; or
                    to ramble with Mr. White ** White’s

                    coppices, as well as with the birds, mice, and squirrels, who
                    inhabit them; or to sail with Robinson
                        Crusoe to his
                            island, and live there with him and his goats and his man
                    Friday;—how much we dread any
                    new comers, any fresh importation of savage or
                        sailor! we never sympathise for a moment in our hero’s want of company, and are quite grieved when he
                    gets away;—or to be shipwrecked with Ferdinand on that other lovelier island—the island of Prospero, and Miranda, and Caliban, and Ariel, and nobody else, none of Dryden’s exotic inventions;—that is best of all. And a small
                    neighbourhood is as good in sober waking reality as in poetry or prose; a
                        village neighbourhood, such as this Berkshire
                    hamlet in which I write, a long, straggling, winding
                    street at the bottom of a fine eminence, with a road
                    through it, always abounding in carts, horsemen, and
                    carriages, and lately enlivened by a stage-coach from
                        B—— to

                    now-a-days; perhaps this may be intended for a monthly diligence, or a fortnightly

                        wife  in her sweepings and dustings. Poor man! he is a very
                    respectable person, and would be a very happy one, if he would add a little
                    employment to his dignity. It would be the salt of life to him.  
                 Next to his house, though parted from it by another long garden with a
                            yew arbour at
                    the end, is the pretty dwelling of the shoemaker, a pale, sickly-looking, black-haired
                    man, the very model of sober industry. There he sits in his little
                        shop from early morning till late at night. An earthquake would
                    hardly stir him: the illumination did not. He stuck immoveably to his last, from
                    the first gradual lighting up, through the long blaze and the gradual decay,
                    till his large solitary candle was the only light in the place. One cannot
                    conceive any thing more perfect than the contempt which the man of
                        transparencies and the man of shoes must have felt for each other on
                    that evening. There was at least as much vanity in the sturdy industry as in the
                    strenuous idleness, for our shoemaker is a man of substance: he employs three
                    journeymen,
                    two lame, and one a dwarf, so that his shop looks like an hospital; he
                    has purchased the lease of his commodious dwelling, some even say that he has
                    bought it out and out; and he has only one pretty daughter, a light,
                    delicate, fair-haired girl of fourteen, the champion, protectress, and
                    playfellow of every brat under three years old, whom she jumps, dances, dandles,
                    and feeds all day long. She is a very attractive person, is that child-loving
                        girl. I have never seen any one in her station who possessed so
                    thoroughly that undefinable charm, the lady-look. See her on a
                    Sunday in her simplicity and her white frock, and she might pass for an earl’s
                    daughter. She likes flowers, too, and has a
                    profusion of white stocks under her
                    window, as pure and delicate as herself. Next to his house, though parted from it by another  long garden long garden  with a

                  The first house on the opposite side of the way is the blacksmith’s; a gloomy dwelling,
                    where the sun never seems to shine; dark and smoky within and without, like a
                    forge. The blacksmith is a high officer
                    in our little state, nothing less than a constable;
                    but, alas! alas! when tumults arise, and the constable is called for, he will commonly be found in the
                    thickest of the fray. Lucky would it be for his wife and her eight children if there were no public-house in
                    the land: an inveterate inclination to enter those bewitching doors is Mr. Constable’s only fault.  The first house on the opposite side of the way is the  blacksmith blacksmith ’s; a gloomy dwelling,

                 Next to this official dwelling is a spruce brick tenement, red, high, and narrow,
                    boasting one above another three sash-windows, the only sash-windows in the
                    village, with a clematis on one side and a
                        rose on the other, tall and narrow
                    like itself. That slender mansion has a fine genteel look. The little parlour
                    seems made for Hogarth’s
                    old maid and her stunted footboy; for tea and
                    card-parties,—it would just hold one table; for the
                    rustle of faded silks, and the splendour of old China; for the delight of four
                    by honours, and a little snug quiet scandal between the deals; for affected
                    gentility and real starvation. This should have been its destiny; but fate has
                    been unpropitious: it belongs to a plump, merry, bustling dame, with four fat, rosy, noisy

                 Then comes the village shop, like other village shops,
                    multifarious as a bazaar; a repository for bread, shoes, tea,

                    thriving, and frugal withal; they have let the upper part of their house to
                        two young women (one of them is a
                        pretty blue-eyed girl) who

                 In a line with the bow-window room is a low garden-wall, belonging to a house
                    under repair:—the white house opposite the
                    collar-maker’s shop, with four
                        lime-trees before it, and a
                        waggon-load of bricks at the door. That house is the plaything of a
                    wealthy, well-meaning, whimsical person, who lives about
                    a mile off. He has a passion for brick and mortar, and, being too wise to meddle
                    with his own residence, diverts himself with altering and re-altering, improving

                    Carpenters and
                    bricklayers have been at work
                    for these eighteen months, and yet I sometimes stand and wonder whether any
                    thing has really been done. One exploit in last June was, however, by no means
                    equivocal. Our good neighbour fancied that the limes shaded the rooms, and made them dark, (there was not
                    a creature in the house but the workmen,) so he had all the
                    leaves stripped from every tree. There they stood, poor
                    miserable skeletons, as bare as Christmas under the glowing midsummer sun.
                    Nature revenged herself in her own sweet and gracious manner; fresh leaves
                    sprang out, and at nearly Christmas the foliage was as brilliant as when the
                    outrage was committed. In a line with the bow-window room is a low garden-wall, belonging to a house
                    under repair:—the white   house opposite the

                         lime-trees lime-trees  before it, and a
                        waggon-load of bricks at the door. That house is the plaything of a

                    a mile off. He has a passion for brick and mortar, and, being too wise to meddle

                    for these eighteen months, and yet I sometimes stand and wonder whether any

                 Next door lives a carpenter,
                    “famed ten miles round, and worthy all his fame;” few
                        cabinet-makers surpass him, with his
                    excellent wife, and their little daughter
                    Lizzy, the plaything and queen of the village, a child
                    three years old according to the register, but six in size and strength and
                    intellect, in power and in self-will. She manages every body in the
                    place, her school-mistress included; turns the
                        wheeler’s children out of their own little cart, and
                    makes them draw her; seduces cakes and lollypops from the very
                    shop window; makes the lazy carry her, the silent talk to
                    her, the grave romp with her; does any thing she pleases; is absolutely
                    irresistible. Her chief attraction lies in her exceeding power of loving, and
                    her firm reliance on the love and indulgence of others. How impossible it would
                    be to disappoint the dear little girl when she runs to meet you, slides her
                    pretty hand into yours, looks up gladly in your face, and says, “Come!” You must
                    go: you cannot help it. Another part of the charm is her singular beauty.
                    Together with a good deal of the character of Napoleon, she has something of his square, sturdy, upright form,
                    with the finest limbs in the world, a complexion purely English, a round
                    laughing face, sunburnt and rosy, large merry blue eyes, curling brown hair, and a
                    wonderful play of countenance. She has the imperial attitudes too, and loves to
                    stand with her hands behind her, or folded over her bosom; and sometimes, when
                    she has a little touch of shyness, she clasps them together on the top of her
                    head, pressing down her shining curls, and looking so exquisitely pretty! Yes,
                    Lizzy is queen of the village! She has but one rival in
                    her dominions, a certain white greyhound called May-flower,
                    much her friend, who resembles her in beauty and strength, in
                    playfulness, and almost in sagacity, and reigns over the animal world as she
                    over the human. They are both coming with me, Lizzy and
                    Lizzy’s “pretty May.” We are now at the end
                    of the street; a cross lane, a
                    rope-walk, shaded with limes and
                    oaks, and a cool clear pond
                    overhung with elms, lead us to the bottom of the
                    hill. There is still one house
                        round the corner, ending in a picturesque
                    wheeler’s shop. The
                        dwelling-house is more ambitious. Look at the fine
                    flowered window-blinds, the green door with the brass knocker, and the somewhat
                    prim but very civil person, who is sending off a
                        labouring man with sirs and curtsies enough for a
                    prince of the blood. Those are the
                    curate’s lodgings—apartments
                    his landlady would call them: he lives with his
                        own family four miles off, but once or twice a week he comes to
                    his neat little parlour to write sermons,
                    to marry, or to bury, as the case may
                    require. Never were better or kinder people than his host
                    and hostess; and there is a fine reflection of clerical
                    importance about them, since their connexion with the
                    Church, which is quite edifying—a decorum, a gravity, a
                    solemn politeness. Oh, to see the worthy wheeler carry the
                    gown after his lodger on a Sunday, nicely pinned up in his
                        wife’s best handkerchief!—or to hear him rebuke a
                    squalling child or a squabbling woman!

                    straggling at the end of the village in a

                    to our mason, the shortest of men, and his
                    handsome, tall wife: he a dwarf, with the voice of a giant; one
                    starts when he begins to talk as if he were shouting through a speaking trumpet;
                    she, the sister,
                    daughter, and grand-daughter, of a
                    long line of gardeners, and no contemptible one herself. It
                    is very magnanimous in me not to hate her; for she beats me in my own way, in
                    chrysanthemums, and dahlias, and
                    the like gauds. Her plants are sure to live; mine have a
                    sad trick of dying, perhaps because I love them, “not wisely, but too
                        well,” and kill them with over-kindness. Half-way up the
                    hill is another detached cottage, the residence of an
                    officer, and his beautiful family.

                 How pleasantly the road winds up the hill, with its broad
                        green borders and hedge-rows so
                    thickly timbered! How finely the evening sun falls on that sandy
                        excavated bank, and touches the 
                            farm-house on the top of the eminence! and how
                    clearly defined and relieved is the figure of the man who
                    is just coming down! It is poor John Evans, the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his wife, and became insane.
                    He was sent to St. Luke’s, and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the workhouse, the pensioner and factotum of the
                    village, amongst whom he divides his services. His mind often wanders, intent on
                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to John
                        Evans, for there is that about him which must be loved; and his
                    unprotectedness, his utter defencelessness, have an irresistible claim on every
                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising cucumbers.
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a
                      melon bed—a melon bed!—fie! What a
                    grand pompous name was that for three melon plants under a
                    hand-light! John Evans is sure that they will succeed. We
                    shall see: as the chancellor said, “I
                        doubt.” How pleasantly the road winds up the  hill, hill,  with its broad
                        green borders and  hedge-rows hedge-rows  so
                    thickly timbered! How finely the evening sun falls on that sandy
                        excavated  bank bank , and touches the 
                            farm-house on the top of the  eminence eminence ! and how
                    clearly defined and relieved is the figure of the  man man  who
                    is just coming down! It is poor  John Evans John Evans , the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his  wife wife , and became   insane.
                    He was sent to  St. Luke’s St. Luke’s , and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the  workhouse workhouse , the pensioner and factotum of the
                    village, amongst whom he divides his services. His mind often wanders, intent on
                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to  John
                        Evans John
                        Evans , for there is that about him which must be loved; and his
                    unprotectedness, his utter defencelessness, have an irresistible claim on every
                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising  cucumbers cucumbers .
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a
                      melon bed—a melon bed!—fie! What a
                    grand pompous name was that for three  melon plants melon plants  under a
                    hand-light!  John Evans John Evans  is sure that they will succeed. We
                    shall see: as the  chancellor chancellor  said,  “I
                        doubt.” “I
                        doubt.” scw: Have not been able to identify this quote. 
                  We are now on the very brow of the eminence, close to the
                            Hill-house and its
                                beautiful garden. On the outer edge of the
                    paling, hanging over the bank
                    that skirts the road, is an old thorn—such
                    a thorn! The long sprays covered with snowy
                    blossoms, so graceful, so elegant, so lightsome, and
                    yet so rich! There only wants a pool under the thorn to give a still lovelier reflection, quivering and
                    trembling, like a tuft of feathers, whiter and greener than the life, and more
                    prettily mixed with the bright blue sky. There should indeed be a
                    pool; but on the dark grass-plat,
                    under the high bank, which is crowned by that
                        magnificent plume, there is something that does almost as
                        well,—Lizzy and May-flower in the
                    midst of a game at romps, “making a sun-shine in the shady
                        place;”
                    Lizzy rolling, laughing, clapping her hands, and glowing
                    like a rose;
                    May-flower playing about her like summer lightning,
                    dazzling the eyes with her sudden turns, her leaps, her bounds, her attacks and
                    her escapes. She darts round the lovely little girl, with
                    the same momentary touch that the swallow skims over the
                    water, and has exactly the same power of flight, the same matchless ease and
                    strength and grace. What a pretty picture they would make; what a pretty
                    foreground they do make to the real landscape! The road winding down the
                        hill with a slight bend, like that in the
                    High-street at Oxford; a
                     waggon slowly ascending, and a
                        horseman cantering up at full speed—(ah!
                    Lizzy,
                    May-flower will certainly desert you to have a gambol with
                    that blood-horse!) half-way down, just at the turn, the
                        red cottage of the lieutenant, covered with vines,
                    the very image of comfort and content; farther down, on the opposite side, the
                        small white dwelling of the little
                    mason; then the limes and the
                    rope-walk; then the village
                        street, peeping through the trees, whose
                    clustering tops hide all but the chimneys and various roofs of the houses, and
                    here and there some angle of a wall: farther on, the elegant town of
                    B——, with its fine old
                    church-towers and spires; the whole view shut in by a range of
                    chalky hills; and over every part of the picture trees, so profusely scattered, that it appears like a
                    woodland scene, with glades and
                        villages intermixed. The trees
                    are of all kinds and all hues, chiefly the finely-shaped elm, of so deep and bright a green, the tips of whose high outer
                    branches drop down with such a crisp and garland-like richness, and the oak, whose stately form is just now so splendidly adorned
                    by the sunny colouring of the young leaves. Turning again up the
                    hill, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm of
                    English scenery, a green common, divided by the road; the
                    right side fringed by hedge-rows and trees, with cottages and 
                        farm-houses irregularly placed, and terminated by a double avenue of
                            noble oaks; the left, prettier still, dappled by bright
                    pools of water, and islands of 
                    cottages and cottage-gardens, and sinking
                    gradually down to corn-fields and
                    meadows, and an old
                        farm-house, with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys, looking outfrom its blooming orchard, and backed by
                    woody hills. The common is itself
                    the prettiest part of the prospect; half covered with low furze, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of
                    the setting sun, and alive with cows and 
                        sheep, and two sets of cricketers: one
                    of young men, surrounded with
                    spectators, some standing, some sitting, some stretched
                    on the grass, all taking a delighted interest in the game;
                    the other, a merry groupe of little boys, at humble
                    distance, for whom even cricket is scarcely lively enough, shouting,
                    leaping, and enjoying themselves to their hearts’ content. But
                        cricketers and country boys are too
                    important persons in our village to be talked of merely
                    as figures in the landscape. They deserve an individual introduction—an essay to
                    themselves—and they shall have it. No fear of forgetting the good-humoured faces
                    that meet us in our walks every day.  We are now on the very brow of the  eminence eminence , close to the
