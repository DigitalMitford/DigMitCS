                March 27th—It is a dull grey morning, with a dewy feeling in the air; fresh, but not windy; cool, but not cold;—the very day for a person newly arrived from the heat, the glare, the noise, and the fever of London, to plunge into the remotest labyrinths of the country, and regain the repose of mind, the calmness of heart, which has been lost in that great Babel. I must go violeting—it is a necessity—and I must go alone: the sound of a voice, even my Lizzy's, the touch of May-flower's head, even the bounding of her elastic foot, would disturb the serenity of feeling which I am trying to recover. I shall go quite alone, with my little basket, twisted like a bee-hive, which I love so well, because she gave it to me, and kept sacred to violets  and to those whom I love; and I shall get out of the high road the moment I can. I would not meet any one just now, even of those whom I best like to meet. 
                Ha!—Is not that group—a gentleman on a blood horse, a lady keeping pace with him so gracefully and easily—see how
                    prettily her veil waves in the wind created by her own rapid motion!—and that
                    gay, gallant boy, on the gallant white Arabian
                    ,
                    curveting at their side, but ready to spring before them every instant—is not
                    that chivalrous-looking party, Mr. and Mrs. M. and dear
                        B.?Needham identifies these characters as John Berkeley Monck, his wife, and their son, Bligh. No!
                    the servant is in a different livery. It is some of the ducal family, and one of
                    their young EtoniansThe 'ducal family' refers to the family of
                        the Duke of Wellington and
                        either of his two sons, ,
                            Arthur, jr., or Charles. I may go on. I shall meet no
                    one now; for I have fairly left the road, and am crossing the lea by one of
                    those wandering paths, amidst the gorse
                    and the heath and the low broom, which the sheep and lambs have made—a path turfy, elastic, thymy, and sweet
                    even at this season.
                We have the good fortune to live in an unenclosed parish, and may thank the wise
                    obstinacy of two or three
                        sturdy farmers, and the lucky unpopularity of a ranting madcap lord of the manor, for
                    preserving the delicious green patches, the islets of wilderness amidst
                    cultivation, which form perhaps the peculiar beauty of English scenery.The beginning of this paragraph renders closely an opinion
                        she expressed to William Elford in
                        a letter from August 20, 1820, in which she
                        expresses an appreciation for unenclosed
                    commons. The
                    common that I am passing now—the lea, as
                    it is called—is one of the loveliest of these favoured spots. It is a little
                    sheltered scene, retiring, as it were, from the village; sunk amidst higher
                    lands, hills would be almost too grand a word; edged on one side by one gay high
                    road, and intersected by another; and surrounded by a most
                    picturesque confusion of meadows, cottages, farms, and orchards; with a great
                    pond in one corner, unusually bright and clear, giving a delightful cheerfulness
                    and daylight to the picture. The swallows
                    haunt that pond; so do the
                        children. There is a merry group round it now; I have
                    seldom seen it without one. Children love water, clear, bright, sparkling water;
                    it excites and feeds their curiosity; it is motion and life.
                The path that I am treading leads to a less lively spot, to that large heavy building on one side of the common,
                    whose solid wings, jutting out far beyond the main body, occupy three sides of a
                    square, and give a cold shadowy look to the court. On one side is a gloomy
                    garden, with an old man digging in
                    it, laid out in straight dark beds of
                    
                    vegetables, potatoes,cabbages, onions, beans; all earthy and
                    mouldy as a newly dug grave. Not a flower or a flowering shrub! Not a rose-tree or a currant-bush! Nothing but for sober melancholy
                    use. Oh how different from the long irregular slips of the cottage-gardens, with
                    their gay bunches of polyanthuses
                    and crocuses, their wallflowers, sending
                    sweet odours through the narrow casement, and their gooseberry-trees, bursting into a brilliancy
                    of leaf, whose vivid greenness has the effect of a blossom on the eye! Oh how
                    different! On the other side of this gloomy abode is a meadow of that deep intense emerald
                    hue, which denotes the presence of stagnant water, surrounded by willows at regular distances, and, like
                    the garden, separated from the common by a wide, moat-like ditch. That is the
                        parish workhouse. All
                    about it is solid, substantial, useful;—but so dreary! so cold! so dark! There
                    are children in the court and
                    yet all is silent. I always hurry past that place, as if it were a prison.
                    Restraint, sickness, age, extreme poverty, misery, which I have no power to
                    remove or alleviate,—these are the ideas, the feelings, which the sight of those
                    walls excites; yet, perhaps, if not certainly, they contain less of that extreme
                    desolation than the morbid fancy is apt to paint. There will be found order,
                    cleanliness, food, clothing, warmth, refuge for 
                        the homeless, medicine and attendance for the sick, rest and sufficiency for old age, and
                    sympathy, the true and active sympathy which the poor show to the poor, for the unhappy. There may be worse places
                    than a parish workhouse—and
                    yet I hurry past it. The feeling, the prejudice will not be
                    controlled.
                The end of the dreary garden edges off into a close-sheltered lane, wandering and winding, like a rivulet, in gentle "sinuosities," (to use a word once applied by Mr. Wilberforce to the Thames at Henley, amidst green meadows, all alive with cattle, sheep, and beautiful lambs,  in the very spring and pride of their tot-tering prettiness: or fields of arable land, more lively still with troops of stooping bean-setters, women and children, in all varieties of costume and colour; and ploughs and harrows, with their whistling boys and steady carters, going through, with a slow and plodding industry, the main business of this busy season. What work bean-setting is! What a reverse of the position assigned to man to distinguish him from the beasts of the field! Only think of stooping for six, eight, ten hours a day, drilling holes in the earth with a little stick, and then dropping in the beans one by one. They are paid according to the quantity they plant; and some of the poor women used to be accused of clumping them—that is to say, dropping more than one bean into a hole. It seems to me, considering the temptation, that not to clump is to be at the very pinnacle of human virtue.
                Another turn in the lane, and we come to the old house standing amongst the high elms—the old farmhouse, which always, I don't know why, carries back my imagination to Shakspeare's days. It is a long, low, irregular building, with one room, at an angle from the house, covered with ivy, fine white-veined ivy; the first floor of the main building projecting and supported by oaken beams, and one of the windows below, with its old casement and long narrow panes, forming the half of a shallow hexagon. A porch, with seats in it, surmounted by a pinnacle, pointed roofs, and clustered chimneys, complete the picture. Alas! it is little else but a picture! The very walls are crumbling to decay under a careless landlord and a ruined tenant.
                Now a few yards farther, and I reach the bank. Ah! I smell them already—their exquisite perfume steams and lingers in this moist heavy air. Through this little gate, and along the green south bank of this green wheat-field, and they burst upon me, the lovely violets, in tenfold loveliness! The ground is covered with them, white and purple, enamelling the short dewy grass, looking but the more vividly coloured under the dull, leaden sky. There they lie by hundreds, by thousands. In former years I have been used to watch them from the tiny green bud, till one or two stole into bloom. They never came on me before in such a sudden and luxuriant glory of simple beauty,—and I do really owe one pure and genuine pleasure to feverish London! How beautifully they are placed too, on this sloping bank, with the palm branches waving over them, full of early bees, and mixing their honeyed scent with the more delicate violet odour! How transparent and smooth and lusty are the branches, full of sap and life! And there, just by the old mossy root, is a superb tuft of primroses, with a yellow butterfly floating over them, and looking like a flower lifted up by the air. What happiness to sit on this turfy knoll, and fill my basket with the blossoms! What a renewal of heart and mind! To sit in such a scene of peace and sweetness is again to be fearless and gay and gentle as a child. Then it is that thought becomes poetry, and feeling religion. Then it is that we are happy and good. Oh that my whole life could pass so, floating on blissful and innocent sensation, enjoying in peace and gratitude the common blessings of nature, thankful above all for the simple habits, the healthful temperament, which render them so dear! Alas! who may dare expect a life of such happiness? But I can at least snatch and prolong the fleeting pleasure, can fill my basket with pure flowers, and my heart with pure thoughts; can gladden my little home with their sweetness; can divide my treasures with one, a dear one!, who cannot seek them; can see them when I shut my eyes; and dream of them when I fall asleep.

                 The path that I am treading leads to a less lively spot, to that large heavy building on one side of the common,
                    whose solid wings, jutting out far beyond the main body, occupy three sides of a
                    square, and give a cold shadowy look to the court. On one side is a gloomy
                    garden, with an old man digging in
                    it, laid out in straight dark beds of
                    
                    vegetables, potatoes,cabbages, onions, beans; all earthy and
                    mouldy as a newly dug grave. Not a flower or a flowering shrub! Not a rose-tree or a currant-bush! Nothing but for sober melancholy
                    use. Oh how different from the long irregular slips of the cottage-gardens, with
                    their gay bunches of polyanthuses
                    and crocuses, their wallflowers, sending
                    sweet odours through the narrow casement, and their gooseberry-trees, bursting into a brilliancy
                    of leaf, whose vivid greenness has the effect of a blossom on the eye! Oh how
                    different! On the other side of this gloomy abode is a meadow of that deep intense emerald
                    hue, which denotes the presence of stagnant water, surrounded by willows at regular distances, and, like
                    the garden, separated from the common by a wide, moat-like ditch. That is the
                        parish workhouse. All
                    about it is solid, substantial, useful;—but so dreary! so cold! so dark! There
                    are children in the court and
                    yet all is silent. I always hurry past that place, as if it were a prison.
                    Restraint, sickness, age, extreme poverty, misery, which I have no power to

                 Another turn in the lane, and we come to the old house standing amongst the high elms—the old farmhouse, which always, I don't know why, carries back my imagination to Shakspeare's days. It is a long, low, irregular building, with one room, at an angle from the house, covered with ivy, fine white-veined ivy; the first floor of the main building projecting and supported by oaken beams, and one of the windows below, with its old casement and long narrow panes, forming the half of a shallow hexagon. A porch, with seats in it, surmounted by a pinnacle, pointed roofs, and clustered chimneys, complete the picture. Alas! it is little else but a picture!

                 Now a few yards farther, and I reach the bank. Ah! I smell them already—their exquisite perfume steams and lingers in this moist heavy air. Through this little gate, and along the green south bank of this green wheat-field, and they burst upon me, the lovely violets, in tenfold loveliness! The ground is covered with them, white and purple, enamelling the short dewy grass, looking but the more vividly coloured under the dull, leaden sky. There they lie by hundreds, by thousands. In former years I have been used to watch them from the tiny green bud, till one or two stole into bloom. They never came on me before in such a sudden and luxuriant glory of simple beauty,—and I do really owe one pure and genuine pleasure to feverish London! How beautifully they are placed too, on this sloping bank, with the palm branches waving over them, full of early bees, and mixing their honeyed scent with the more delicate violet odour! How transparent and smooth and lusty are the branches, full of sap and life! And there, just by the old mossy root, is a superb tuft of primroses, with a yellow butterfly floating over them, and looking like a flower lifted up by the air. What happiness to sit on this turfy knoll, and fill my basket with the blossoms! What a renewal of heart and mind! To sit in such a scene of peace and sweetness is again to be fearless and gay and gentle as a child. Then it is that thought becomes poetry, and feeling religion. Then it is that we are happy and good. Oh that my whole life could pass so, floating on blissful and innocent sensation, enjoying in peace and gratitude the common blessings of nature, thankful above all for the simple habits, the healthful temperament, which render them so dear! Alas! who may dare expect a life of such happiness? But I can at least snatch and prolong the fleeting pleasure, can fill my basket with pure flowers, and my heart with pure thoughts; can gladden my little home with their sweetness; can divide my treasures with one, a dear one!, who cannot seek them; can see them when I shut my eyes; and dream of them when I fall asleep.
