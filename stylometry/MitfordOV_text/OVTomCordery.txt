            
                TOM CORDERY.
                There are certain things and persons that look as if they could never die: things
                    of such vigour and hardiness, that they seem constituted for an interminable
                    duration, a sort of immortality. An old pollard oak of my acquaintance
                    used to give me this impression. Never was tree so gnarled, so knotted, so full
                        of crooked life. Garlanded with ivy and woodbine,
                    almost bending under the weight of its own rich leaves and acorns, tough,
                    vigorous, lusty, concentrating as it were the very spirit of vitality into its
                    own curtailed proportions,—could that tree ever die? I have asked myself twenty
                    times, as I stood looking on the deep water over which it hung, and in which it
                    seemed to live again—would that strong dwarf ever fall? Alas! the question is
                    answered. Walking by the spot to-day—this very day—there it lay prostrate; the
                    ivy still clinging about it, 
                    the twigs swelling with sap, and putting forth
                    already the early buds. There it lay a victim to the taste and skill of some
                    admirer  of British woods, who with the tact of Ugo Foscolo (that
                    prince of amateurs) has discovered in the knots and gnarls of the exterior coat
                    the leopard-like beauty which is concealed within the trunk. There it lies, a
                    type of sylvan instability, fallen like an emperor. Another piece of strong
                    nature in a human form used to convey to me exactly the same feeling—and he is
                    gone too! Tom Cordery is dead. 
                    The bell is tolling for him at this very moment.
                    Tom Cordery dead! the words seem 
                    almost a contradiction. One is tempted to send
                    for the sexton and the undertaker, to undig the grave, to force open the
                    coffin-lid—there must be some mistake. But, alas! it is too true; the typhus
                    fever, that axe which levels the strong as the weak, has hewed him down at a
                    blow. Poor Tom Cordery!
                 This human oak grew on the wild 
                    North-of-Hampshire country, of which I have
                    before made honourable mention; a country of heath, 
                    and hill, and forest, partly
                    reclaimed, inclosed, and planted by some of the >greater proprietors, but for the
                    most part uncultivated and uncivilised; a proper refuge for wild animals of
                    every species. Of these the most notable was my friend Tom Cordery, who
                    presented in his own person no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived—the gentlest of savages, 
                    the wildest of civilised men. He was by calling
                    rat-catcher, hare-finder, and broom-maker; a triad of trades
                    which he had substituted for the one grand profession of poaching, which he had
                    followed in his younger days with unrivalled talent and success, and would,
                    undoubtedly, have pursued till his death, had not the bursting of an overloaded
                    gun unluckily shot off his left hand. As it was, he still contrived to mingle a
                    little of his old unlawful occupation with his honest callings; was a reference
                    of high authority amongst the young aspirants, an adviser of undoubted honour
                    and secresy—suspected, and more than suspected, as being one “who, though he
                        played no more, o’erlooked the cards.” Yet he kept to windward of the law, and
                    indeed contrived to be on such terms of social and even friendly intercourse
                    with the guardians of the game on M. Common, as may be said to prevail between
                    reputed thieves and the myrmidons of justice in the neighbourhood of Bow-street.
                    Indeed his especial crony, the head-keeper, 
                    used sometimes to hint, when Tom,
                    elevated by ale, had provoked him by overcrowing, “that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as Tom Cordery.” This conjecture, never broached
                    till the keeper was warm with wrath and 
                    liquor, and Tom fairly out of hearing,
                    always seemed to me a little super-subtle; but it is certain that 
                    Tom’s new
                    professions did bear rather a suspicious analogy to the  old, and
                    the ferrets, and terriers, and mongrels by whom he was surrounded, 
                    “did really
                        look,” as the worthy keeper observed, “fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin.” So in 
                    good truth did Tom himself. Never
                    did any human being look more like that sort of sportsman commonly called a
                    poacher. He was a tall, finely-built man, with a prodigious stride, that cleared
                    the ground like a horse, and a power of continuing his slow and steady speed,
                    that seemed nothing less than miraculous. Neither man, nor horse, nor dog, could
                    out-tire him. He had a bold, undaunted presence, and an evident strength and
                    power of bone and muscle. You might see by looking at him, that he did not know
                    what fear meant. In his youth he had fought more battles than any man in the
                    forest. He was as if born without nerves, totally insensible to the recoils and
                    disgusts of humanity. I have known 
                    him take up a huge adder, cut off its head,
                    and then deposit the living and writhing body in his brimless hat, and walking with
                    it coiling and wreathing about his head, like another Medusa, till the sport of
                    the day was over, and he carried it home to secure the fat. With all this iron
                    stubbornness of nature, he was of a most mild and gentle demeanour, had a fine
                    placidity of countenance, and a quick blue eye beaming with good humour. His
                    face was sunburnt into one general  pale vermilion hue that
                    overspread all his features; his very hair was sunburnt too. His costume was
                    generally a smock-frock of no doubtful complexion, dirt-coloured, which hung
                    round him in tatters like fringe, rather augmenting than diminishing the
                    freedom, and, if I may so say, the gallantry of his bearing. This frock was
                    furnished with a huge inside pocket, in which to deposit the game killed by his
                    patrons—for of his three employments, that which consisted of finding hares for
                    the great farmers and small gentry, who were wont to course on the common, was
                    by far the most profitable and most pleasing to him, and to them. Every body
                    liked Tom Cordery. 
                    He had himself an aptness to like, which is almost certain to be
                    repaid in kind—the very dogs knew him, and loved him, and would beat for him
                    almost as soon as for their master. Even May, 
                    the most sagacious of greyhounds,
                    appreciated his talents, and would almost as soon listen to 
                    Tom sohoing as to old 
                    Tray
                    giving tongue.
                Nor was his conversation less agreeable to the other part of the company.
                    Servants and masters 
                    were equally desirous to secure Tom. Besides his general
                    and professional familiarity with beasts and birds, their ways and doings, a
                    knowledge so minute and accurate, that it might have put to shame many a
                    professed naturalist, he had no small acquaintance with the goings-on of that
                    unfeathered biped called man; in short, he was,  next after Lucy,
                    who recognised his rivalry by hating, decrying, and undervaluing him, by far the
                    best news-gatherer of the country side. His news he of course picked up on the
                    civilised side of the parish, (there is no gossiping in the forest,) partly at
                    that well-frequented inn the Red Lion, 
                    of which Tom was a regular and noted
                    supporter—partly amongst his several employers, and partly by his own sagacity.
                    In the matter of marriages, (pairings he was wont to call them,) he relied
                    chiefly on his own skill in noting certain preliminary indications; and
                    certainly for a guesser by profession and a very bold one, he was astonishingly
                    often right. At the alehouse especially, he was of the first authority. An air
                    of mild importance, a diplomatic reserve on some points, great smoothness of
                    speech, and that gentleness which is so often the result of conscious power,
                    made him there an absolute ruler. Perhaps the effect of these causes might be a
                    little aided by the latent dread which that power inspired in others. Many an
                    exploit had proved that Tom Cordery’s 
                    one arm was fairly worth any two on the
                    common. The pommelling of Bob Arlott, and 
                    the levelling of Jem Serle to the
                    earth by one swing of a huge old hare, (which unusual weapon was by the way the
                    first-slain of Mayflower, on its way home
                    to us in that walking cupboard, his
                    pocket, when the unlucky rencontre with Jem Serle
                    broke two heads, the dead  and the living,) arguments such as these might have some cogency
                    at the Red Lion.
                But he managed every body, as your gentle-mannered person is apt to do. Even the
                    rude ‘squires and rough 
                    farmers, his temporary masters, he managed, particularly
                    as far as concerned the beat, and was sure to bring them round to his own
                    peculiar fancies or prejudices, however strongly their own wishes might turn
                    them aside from the direction indicated, and however often 
                    Tom’s sagacity in
                    that instance might have been found at fault. Two spots in the 
                    large wild
                        inclosures into which the heath 
                    had been divided were his especial favourites;
                    the Hundred Acres, alias the Poor Allotment, 
                        alias the Burnt Common—
                    (Do any or
                    all of these titles convey any notion of the real destination of that many-named
                        place? a piece of moor land portioned out to 
                    serve for fuel to the poor of the
                    parish)—this was one. Oh the barrenness of this miserable moor! Flat, marshy,
                    dingy, bare. Here that piece of green treachery, 
                    a bog; there parched, and
                    pared, and shrivelled, and black with smoke and ashes; utterly desolate and
                    wretched every where, except where amidst the desolation blossomed, as in
                    mockery, the enamelled gentianella. 
                    No hares ever came there; they had too much
                    taste. Yet thither would Tom 
                    lead his unwary employers; thither, however warned,
                    or cautioned, or experienced, would he by reasoning or induction,
                    or gentle persuasion, or actual fraud, 
                    entice the hapless gentlemen; and then to
                    see him with his rabble of finders pacing up and down this precious
                    “sitting-ground,” (for so was Tom, thriftless liar, wont to call it,) pretending
                    to look for game, counterfeiting a meuse; forging a form; and telling a story
                    some ten years old of a famous hare once killed in that spot by his honour’s
                    favourite bitch Marygold. I never could thoroughly understand whether it were
                    design, a fear that too many hares might be killed, or a real and honest
                    mistake, a genuine prejudice in favour of the place, that influenced Tom Cordery
                    in this point. Half the one, perhaps, and half the other. Mixed motives, let
                    Pope and 
                    his disciples say what they will, are by far the commonest in this
                    parti-coloured world. Or he had shared the fate of greater men, and lied till he
                    believed—a coursing Cromwell, beginning in hypocrisy and ending in fanaticism.
                    Another pet spot was the Gallows-piece, an inclosure almost as large as the
                    Hundred Acres, where a gibbet had once borne the bodies of two murderers, with
                    the chains and bones, even in my remembrance, clanking and creaking in the wind.
                    The gibbet was gone now; but the name remained, and the feeling, deep, sad, and
                    shuddering. The place, too, 
                    was wild, awful, fearful; a heathy, furzy spot,
                    sinking into broken hollows, 
                    where murderers might lurk; a few withered pines at
                    the upper end, and  amongst them, half hidden by the brambles, the
                    stone in which the gallows had been fixed;—the bones must have been mouldering
                    beneath. All Tom’s eloquence, 
                    seconded by two capital courses, failed to drag me
                    thither a second time.
                Tom was not, however, 
                    without that strong sense of natural beauty which they who
                    live amongst the wildernesses and fastnesses of nature so often exhibit. One spot,
                    where the common trenches on the civilized world, 
                    was scarcely less his
                    admiration than mine. It is a high hill, 
                    half covered with furze, and heath, and
                    broom, and sinking abruptly down to a large pond, almost a lake, covered with
                    wild water fowl. The ground, richly clothed with wood, 
                    oak, and beech, and 
                    elm,
                    rises on the other side with equal abruptness, as if shutting in those glassy
                    waters from all but the sky, which shines so brightly in their clear bosom: just
                    in the bottom peeps a small sheltered farm, whose wreaths of light smoke and the
                    white glancing wings of the wild ducks, as they flit across the lake, are all
                    that give token of motion or of life. I 
                    have stood there in utter oblivion of
                    greyhound or of hare, till moments have swelled to minutes, and minutes to
                    hours; and so has Tom, conveying, 
                    by his exclamations of delight at its
                    “pleasantness,” exactly the same feeling 
                    which a poet or a painter (for it
                    breathes the very spirit of calm and sunshiny beauty that a master-painter
                    loves) would express by different but not truer praise. He called
                    his own home “pleasant” too; and there, 
                    though one loves to hear any home so
                    called—there, I must confess, that favourite phrase, which I like almost as well
                    as they who have no other, did seem rather misapplied. And yet it was finely
                    placed, very finely. It stood in a sort of defile, 
                    where a road almost
                    perpendicular wound from the top of a steep abrupt hill, 
                    crowned with a tuft of
                        old Scottish firs, 
                    into a dingle of fern and wild brushwood. A shallow, sullen
                            stream oozed from the bank on one side, and, after forming a rude channel across
                    the road, sank into a dark, deep pool, half hidden amongst the sallows. Behind
                    these sallows, in a nook between them and 
                    the hill, rose the uncouth and
                    shapeless cottage of Tom Cordery.  
                    It is a scene which hangs upon the eye and the
                    memory, striking, grand, almost sublime, and above all eminently foreign. No
                    English painter would choose such a subject for an English landscape; no one in
                    a picture would take it for English. It might pass for one of those scenes which
                    have furnished models to Salvator Rosa. 
                    Tom’s cottage was, however, very
                    thoroughly national and characteristic; a low, ruinous hovel, the door of which
                    was fastened with a sedulous attention to security, that contrasted strangely
                    with the tattered thatch of the roof, and the half broken windows. No garden, no
                    pigsty,  no pens for geese, none of the usual signs of cottage
                    habitation:—yet the house was covered with nondescript dwellings, and the very
                    walls were animate with their extraordinary tenants; pheasants, partridges,
                    rabbits, tame wild ducks, half tame hares, and their enemies by nature and
                    education, the ferrets, terriers, and mongrels, of whom his retinue consisted.
                    Great ingenuity had been evinced in keeping separate these jarring elements; and
                    by dint of hutches, cages, fences, kennel, and half a dozen little hurdled
                    inclosures resembling the sort of courts which children are apt to build round
                    their card-houses, peace was in general tolerably well preserved. Frequent
                    sounds, however, of fear or of anger, as their several instincts were aroused,
                    gave token that it was but a forced and hollow truce, and at such times the
                    clamour was prodigious. Tom had the 
                    remarkable tenderness for animals when
                    domesticated, which is so often found in those whose sole vocation seems to be
                    their destruction in the field; and the one long, straggling, unceiled,
                    barn-like room, which served for kitchen, bed-chamber, and hall, was cumbered
                    with bipeds and quadrupeds of all kinds and descriptions—the sick, the delicate,
                    the newly caught, the lying-in. In the midst of this menagerie sate 
                    Tom’s wife,
                    (for he was married, though without a family—married to a 
                    woman lame of a leg as
                    he himself was minus an arm,) now trying to quiet her noisy
                    inmates, now to outscold them. How long his friend 
                    the keeper would have
                    continued to wink at this den of live game, none can say: the roof fairly fell
                    in during the deep snow of last winter, killing, as poor 
                    Tom observed, two as
                    fine litters of rabbits as ever were kittened. Remotely, I have no doubt that he
                    himself fell a sacrifice to this misadventure. The 
                    overseer, to whom he applied
                    to re-instate his beloved habitation, decided that the walls would never bear
                    another roof, and removed him and his wife, 
                    as an especial favour, to a tidy,
                    snug, comfortable room in the workhouse,
                    The workhouse! From that hour poor 
                    Tom
                    visibly altered. He lost his hilarity and independence. It was a change such as
                    he had himself often inflicted, a complete change of habits, a transition from
                    the wild to the tame. No labour was demanded of him; he went about as before,
                    finding hares, killing rats, selling brooms, but the spirit of the man was
                    departed. He talked of the quiet of his old abode, and the noise of the new;
                    complained of children and other 
                    bad company; and looked down on his neighbours
                    with the sort of contempt with which a cock pheasant might regard a barn-door
                    fowl. Most of all did he, braced into a gipsey-like defiance of wet and cold,
                    grumble at the warmth and dryness of his apartment. He used to foretell that it
                    would kill him, and  assuredly it did so. Never could the typhus
                    fever have found out that wild hill side, 
                    or have lurked under that broken roof. The free touch of the air 
                    would have chased the daemon. Alas, poor Tom! 
                    warmth, and snugness,
                    and comfort, whole windows, and an entire ceiling, 
                    were the death of him. Alas, poor Tom!
            
         
             
                TOM CORDERY.
                There are certain things and persons that look as if they could never die: things
                    of such vigour and hardiness, that they seem constituted for an interminable
                    duration, a sort of immortality. An old pollard oak of my acquaintance
                    used to give me this impression. Never was tree so gnarled, so knotted, so full
                        of crooked life. Garlanded with ivy and woodbine,
                    almost bending under the weight of its own rich leaves and acorns, tough,
                    vigorous, lusty, concentrating as it were the very spirit of vitality into its
                    own curtailed proportions,—could that tree ever die? I have asked myself twenty
                    times, as I stood looking on the deep water over which it hung, and in which it
                    seemed to live again—would that strong dwarf ever fall? Alas! the question is
                    answered. Walking by the spot to-day—this very day—there it lay prostrate; the
                    ivy still clinging about it, 
                    the twigs swelling with sap, and putting forth
                    already the early buds. There it lay a victim to the taste and skill of some
                    admirer  of British woods, who with the tact of Ugo Foscolo (that
                    prince of amateurs) has discovered in the knots and gnarls of the exterior coat
                    the leopard-like beauty which is concealed within the trunk. There it lies, a
                    type of sylvan instability, fallen like an emperor. Another piece of strong
                    nature in a human form used to convey to me exactly the same feeling—and he is
                    gone too! Tom Cordery is dead. 
                    The bell is tolling for him at this very moment.
                    Tom Cordery dead! the words seem 
                    almost a contradiction. One is tempted to send
                    for the sexton and the undertaker, to undig the grave, to force open the
                    coffin-lid—there must be some mistake. But, alas! it is too true; the typhus
                    fever, that axe which levels the strong as the weak, has hewed him down at a
                    blow. Poor Tom Cordery!
                 This human oak grew on the wild 
                    North-of-Hampshire country, of which I have
                    before made honourable mention; a country of heath, 
                    and hill, and forest, partly
                    reclaimed, inclosed, and planted by some of the >greater proprietors, but for the
                    most part uncultivated and uncivilised; a proper refuge for wild animals of
                    every species. Of these the most notable was my friend Tom Cordery, who
                    presented in his own person no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived—the gentlest of savages, 
                    the wildest of civilised men. He was by calling
                    rat-catcher, hare-finder, and broom-maker; a triad of trades
                    which he had substituted for the one grand profession of poaching, which he had
                    followed in his younger days with unrivalled talent and success, and would,
                    undoubtedly, have pursued till his death, had not the bursting of an overloaded
                    gun unluckily shot off his left hand. As it was, he still contrived to mingle a
                    little of his old unlawful occupation with his honest callings; was a reference
                    of high authority amongst the young aspirants, an adviser of undoubted honour
                    and secresy—suspected, and more than suspected, as being one “who, though he
                        played no more, o’erlooked the cards.” Yet he kept to windward of the law, and
                    indeed contrived to be on such terms of social and even friendly intercourse
                    with the guardians of the game on M. Common, as may be said to prevail between
                    reputed thieves and the myrmidons of justice in the neighbourhood of Bow-street.
                    Indeed his especial crony, the head-keeper, 
                    used sometimes to hint, when Tom,
                    elevated by ale, had provoked him by overcrowing, “that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as Tom Cordery.” This conjecture, never broached
                    till the keeper was warm with wrath and 
                    liquor, and Tom fairly out of hearing,
                    always seemed to me a little super-subtle; but it is certain that 
                    Tom’s new
                    professions did bear rather a suspicious analogy to the  old, and
                    the ferrets, and terriers, and mongrels by whom he was surrounded, 
                    “did really
                        look,” as the worthy keeper observed, “fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin.” So in 
                    good truth did Tom himself. Never
                    did any human being look more like that sort of sportsman commonly called a
                    poacher. He was a tall, finely-built man, with a prodigious stride, that cleared
                    the ground like a horse, and a power of continuing his slow and steady speed,
                    that seemed nothing less than miraculous. Neither man, nor horse, nor dog, could
                    out-tire him. He had a bold, undaunted presence, and an evident strength and
                    power of bone and muscle. You might see by looking at him, that he did not know
                    what fear meant. In his youth he had fought more battles than any man in the
                    forest. He was as if born without nerves, totally insensible to the recoils and
                    disgusts of humanity. I have known 
                    him take up a huge adder, cut off its head,
                    and then deposit the living and writhing body in his brimless hat, and walking with
                    it coiling and wreathing about his head, like another Medusa, till the sport of
                    the day was over, and he carried it home to secure the fat. With all this iron
                    stubbornness of nature, he was of a most mild and gentle demeanour, had a fine
                    placidity of countenance, and a quick blue eye beaming with good humour. His
                    face was sunburnt into one general  pale vermilion hue that
                    overspread all his features; his very hair was sunburnt too. His costume was
                    generally a smock-frock of no doubtful complexion, dirt-coloured, which hung
                    round him in tatters like fringe, rather augmenting than diminishing the
                    freedom, and, if I may so say, the gallantry of his bearing. This frock was
                    furnished with a huge inside pocket, in which to deposit the game killed by his
                    patrons—for of his three employments, that which consisted of finding hares for
                    the great farmers and small gentry, who were wont to course on the common, was
                    by far the most profitable and most pleasing to him, and to them. Every body
                    liked Tom Cordery. 
                    He had himself an aptness to like, which is almost certain to be
                    repaid in kind—the very dogs knew him, and loved him, and would beat for him
                    almost as soon as for their master. Even May, 
                    the most sagacious of greyhounds,
                    appreciated his talents, and would almost as soon listen to 
                    Tom sohoing as to old 
                    Tray
                    giving tongue.
                Nor was his conversation less agreeable to the other part of the company.
                    Servants and masters 
                    were equally desirous to secure Tom. Besides his general
                    and professional familiarity with beasts and birds, their ways and doings, a
                    knowledge so minute and accurate, that it might have put to shame many a
                    professed naturalist, he had no small acquaintance with the goings-on of that
                    unfeathered biped called man; in short, he was,  next after Lucy,
                    who recognised his rivalry by hating, decrying, and undervaluing him, by far the
                    best news-gatherer of the country side. His news he of course picked up on the
                    civilised side of the parish, (there is no gossiping in the forest,) partly at
                    that well-frequented inn the Red Lion, 
                    of which Tom was a regular and noted
                    supporter—partly amongst his several employers, and partly by his own sagacity.
                    In the matter of marriages, (pairings he was wont to call them,) he relied
                    chiefly on his own skill in noting certain preliminary indications; and
                    certainly for a guesser by profession and a very bold one, he was astonishingly
                    often right. At the alehouse especially, he was of the first authority. An air
                    of mild importance, a diplomatic reserve on some points, great smoothness of
                    speech, and that gentleness which is so often the result of conscious power,
                    made him there an absolute ruler. Perhaps the effect of these causes might be a
                    little aided by the latent dread which that power inspired in others. Many an
                    exploit had proved that Tom Cordery’s 
                    one arm was fairly worth any two on the
                    common. The pommelling of Bob Arlott, and 
                    the levelling of Jem Serle to the
                    earth by one swing of a huge old hare, (which unusual weapon was by the way the
                    first-slain of Mayflower, on its way home
                    to us in that walking cupboard, his
                    pocket, when the unlucky rencontre with Jem Serle
                    broke two heads, the dead  and the living,) arguments such as these might have some cogency
                    at the Red Lion.
                But he managed every body, as your gentle-mannered person is apt to do. Even the
                    rude ‘squires and rough 
                    farmers, his temporary masters, he managed, particularly
                    as far as concerned the beat, and was sure to bring them round to his own
                    peculiar fancies or prejudices, however strongly their own wishes might turn
                    them aside from the direction indicated, and however often 
                    Tom’s sagacity in
                    that instance might have been found at fault. Two spots in the 
                    large wild
                        inclosures into which the heath 
                    had been divided were his especial favourites;
                    the Hundred Acres, alias the Poor Allotment, 
                        alias the Burnt Common—
                    (Do any or
                    all of these titles convey any notion of the real destination of that many-named
                        place? a piece of moor land portioned out to 
                    serve for fuel to the poor of the
                    parish)—this was one. Oh the barrenness of this miserable moor! Flat, marshy,
                    dingy, bare. Here that piece of green treachery, 
                    a bog; there parched, and
                    pared, and shrivelled, and black with smoke and ashes; utterly desolate and
                    wretched every where, except where amidst the desolation blossomed, as in
                    mockery, the enamelled gentianella. 
                    No hares ever came there; they had too much
                    taste. Yet thither would Tom 
                    lead his unwary employers; thither, however warned,
                    or cautioned, or experienced, would he by reasoning or induction,
                    or gentle persuasion, or actual fraud, 
                    entice the hapless gentlemen; and then to
                    see him with his rabble of finders pacing up and down this precious
                    “sitting-ground,” (for so was Tom, thriftless liar, wont to call it,) pretending
                    to look for game, counterfeiting a meuse; forging a form; and telling a story
                    some ten years old of a famous hare once killed in that spot by his honour’s
                    favourite bitch Marygold. I never could thoroughly understand whether it were
                    design, a fear that too many hares might be killed, or a real and honest
                    mistake, a genuine prejudice in favour of the place, that influenced Tom Cordery
                    in this point. Half the one, perhaps, and half the other. Mixed motives, let
                    Pope and 
                    his disciples say what they will, are by far the commonest in this
                    parti-coloured world. Or he had shared the fate of greater men, and lied till he
                    believed—a coursing Cromwell, beginning in hypocrisy and ending in fanaticism.
                    Another pet spot was the Gallows-piece, an inclosure almost as large as the
                    Hundred Acres, where a gibbet had once borne the bodies of two murderers, with
                    the chains and bones, even in my remembrance, clanking and creaking in the wind.
                    The gibbet was gone now; but the name remained, and the feeling, deep, sad, and
                    shuddering. The place, too, 
                    was wild, awful, fearful; a heathy, furzy spot,
                    sinking into broken hollows, 
                    where murderers might lurk; a few withered pines at
                    the upper end, and  amongst them, half hidden by the brambles, the
                    stone in which the gallows had been fixed;—the bones must have been mouldering
                    beneath. All Tom’s eloquence, 
                    seconded by two capital courses, failed to drag me
                    thither a second time.
                Tom was not, however, 
                    without that strong sense of natural beauty which they who
                    live amongst the wildernesses and fastnesses of nature so often exhibit. One spot,
                    where the common trenches on the civilized world, 
                    was scarcely less his
                    admiration than mine. It is a high hill, 
                    half covered with furze, and heath, and
                    broom, and sinking abruptly down to a large pond, almost a lake, covered with
                    wild water fowl. The ground, richly clothed with wood, 
                    oak, and beech, and 
                    elm,
                    rises on the other side with equal abruptness, as if shutting in those glassy
                    waters from all but the sky, which shines so brightly in their clear bosom: just
                    in the bottom peeps a small sheltered farm, whose wreaths of light smoke and the
                    white glancing wings of the wild ducks, as they flit across the lake, are all
                    that give token of motion or of life. I 
                    have stood there in utter oblivion of
                    greyhound or of hare, till moments have swelled to minutes, and minutes to
                    hours; and so has Tom, conveying, 
                    by his exclamations of delight at its
                    “pleasantness,” exactly the same feeling 
                    which a poet or a painter (for it
                    breathes the very spirit of calm and sunshiny beauty that a master-painter
                    loves) would express by different but not truer praise. He called
                    his own home “pleasant” too; and there, 
                    though one loves to hear any home so
                    called—there, I must confess, that favourite phrase, which I like almost as well
                    as they who have no other, did seem rather misapplied. And yet it was finely
                    placed, very finely. It stood in a sort of defile, 
                    where a road almost
                    perpendicular wound from the top of a steep abrupt hill, 
                    crowned with a tuft of
                        old Scottish firs, 
                    into a dingle of fern and wild brushwood. A shallow, sullen
                            stream oozed from the bank on one side, and, after forming a rude channel across
                    the road, sank into a dark, deep pool, half hidden amongst the sallows. Behind
                    these sallows, in a nook between them and 
                    the hill, rose the uncouth and
                    shapeless cottage of Tom Cordery.  
                    It is a scene which hangs upon the eye and the
                    memory, striking, grand, almost sublime, and above all eminently foreign. No
                    English painter would choose such a subject for an English landscape; no one in
                    a picture would take it for English. It might pass for one of those scenes which
                    have furnished models to Salvator Rosa. 
                    Tom’s cottage was, however, very
                    thoroughly national and characteristic; a low, ruinous hovel, the door of which
                    was fastened with a sedulous attention to security, that contrasted strangely
                    with the tattered thatch of the roof, and the half broken windows. No garden, no
                    pigsty,  no pens for geese, none of the usual signs of cottage
                    habitation:—yet the house was covered with nondescript dwellings, and the very
                    walls were animate with their extraordinary tenants; pheasants, partridges,
                    rabbits, tame wild ducks, half tame hares, and their enemies by nature and
                    education, the ferrets, terriers, and mongrels, of whom his retinue consisted.
                    Great ingenuity had been evinced in keeping separate these jarring elements; and
                    by dint of hutches, cages, fences, kennel, and half a dozen little hurdled
                    inclosures resembling the sort of courts which children are apt to build round
                    their card-houses, peace was in general tolerably well preserved. Frequent
                    sounds, however, of fear or of anger, as their several instincts were aroused,
                    gave token that it was but a forced and hollow truce, and at such times the
                    clamour was prodigious. Tom had the 
                    remarkable tenderness for animals when
                    domesticated, which is so often found in those whose sole vocation seems to be
                    their destruction in the field; and the one long, straggling, unceiled,
                    barn-like room, which served for kitchen, bed-chamber, and hall, was cumbered
                    with bipeds and quadrupeds of all kinds and descriptions—the sick, the delicate,
                    the newly caught, the lying-in. In the midst of this menagerie sate 
                    Tom’s wife,
                    (for he was married, though without a family—married to a 
                    woman lame of a leg as
                    he himself was minus an arm,) now trying to quiet her noisy
                    inmates, now to outscold them. How long his friend 
                    the keeper would have
                    continued to wink at this den of live game, none can say: the roof fairly fell
                    in during the deep snow of last winter, killing, as poor 
                    Tom observed, two as
                    fine litters of rabbits as ever were kittened. Remotely, I have no doubt that he
                    himself fell a sacrifice to this misadventure. The 
                    overseer, to whom he applied
                    to re-instate his beloved habitation, decided that the walls would never bear
                    another roof, and removed him and his wife, 
                    as an especial favour, to a tidy,
                    snug, comfortable room in the workhouse,
                    The workhouse! From that hour poor 
                    Tom
                    visibly altered. He lost his hilarity and independence. It was a change such as
                    he had himself often inflicted, a complete change of habits, a transition from
                    the wild to the tame. No labour was demanded of him; he went about as before,
                    finding hares, killing rats, selling brooms, but the spirit of the man was
                    departed. He talked of the quiet of his old abode, and the noise of the new;
                    complained of children and other 
                    bad company; and looked down on his neighbours
                    with the sort of contempt with which a cock pheasant might regard a barn-door
                    fowl. Most of all did he, braced into a gipsey-like defiance of wet and cold,
                    grumble at the warmth and dryness of his apartment. He used to foretell that it
                    would kill him, and  assuredly it did so. Never could the typhus
                    fever have found out that wild hill side, 
                    or have lurked under that broken roof. The free touch of the air 
                    would have chased the daemon. Alas, poor Tom! 
                    warmth, and snugness,
                    and comfort, whole windows, and an entire ceiling, 
                    were the death of him. Alas, poor Tom!
             
                 TOM CORDERY. TOM CORDERY TOM CORDERY . 
                 There are certain things and persons that look as if they could never die: things
                    of such vigour and hardiness, that they seem constituted for an interminable
                    duration, a sort of immortality. An old pollard oak of my acquaintance
                    used to give me this impression. Never was tree so gnarled, so knotted, so full
                        of crooked life. Garlanded with ivy and woodbine,
                    almost bending under the weight of its own rich leaves and acorns, tough,
                    vigorous, lusty, concentrating as it were the very spirit of vitality into its
                    own curtailed proportions,—could that tree ever die? I have asked myself twenty
                    times, as I stood looking on the deep water over which it hung, and in which it
                    seemed to live again—would that strong dwarf ever fall? Alas! the question is
                    answered. Walking by the spot to-day—this very day—there it lay prostrate; the
                    ivy still clinging about it, 
                    the twigs swelling with sap, and putting forth
                    already the early buds. There it lay a victim to the taste and skill of some
                    admirer  of British woods, who with the tact of Ugo Foscolo (that
                    prince of amateurs) has discovered in the knots and gnarls of the exterior coat
                    the leopard-like beauty which is concealed within the trunk. There it lies, a
                    type of sylvan instability, fallen like an emperor. Another piece of strong
                    nature in a human form used to convey to me exactly the same feeling—and he is
                    gone too! Tom Cordery is dead. 
                    The bell is tolling for him at this very moment.
                    Tom Cordery dead! the words seem 
                    almost a contradiction. One is tempted to send
                    for the sexton and the undertaker, to undig the grave, to force open the
                    coffin-lid—there must be some mistake. But, alas! it is too true; the typhus
                    fever, that axe which levels the strong as the weak, has hewed him down at a
                    blow. Poor Tom Cordery! There are certain things and persons that look as if they could never die: things

                     Tom Cordery Tom Cordery  dead! the words seem 
                    almost a contradiction. One is tempted to send

                    fever, that axe which levels the strong as the weak, has hewed him down at a
                    blow. Poor  Tom Cordery Tom Cordery ! 
                  This human oak grew on the wild 
                    North-of-Hampshire country, of which I have
                    before made honourable mention; a country of heath, 
                    and hill, and forest, partly
                    reclaimed, inclosed, and planted by some of the >greater proprietors, but for the
                    most part uncultivated and uncivilised; a proper refuge for wild animals of
                    every species. Of these the most notable was my friend Tom Cordery, who
                    presented in his own person no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived—the gentlest of savages, 
                    the wildest of civilised men. He was by calling
                    rat-catcher, hare-finder, and broom-maker; a triad of trades
                    which he had substituted for the one grand profession of poaching, which he had
                    followed in his younger days with unrivalled talent and success, and would,
                    undoubtedly, have pursued till his death, had not the bursting of an overloaded
                    gun unluckily shot off his left hand. As it was, he still contrived to mingle a
                    little of his old unlawful occupation with his honest callings; was a reference
                    of high authority amongst the young aspirants, an adviser of undoubted honour
                    and secresy—suspected, and more than suspected, as being one “who, though he
                        played no more, o’erlooked the cards.” Yet he kept to windward of the law, and
                    indeed contrived to be on such terms of social and even friendly intercourse
                    with the guardians of the game on M. Common, as may be said to prevail between
                    reputed thieves and the myrmidons of justice in the neighbourhood of Bow-street.
                    Indeed his especial crony, the head-keeper, 
                    used sometimes to hint, when Tom,
                    elevated by ale, had provoked him by overcrowing, “that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as Tom Cordery.” This conjecture, never broached
                    till the keeper was warm with wrath and 
                    liquor, and Tom fairly out of hearing,
                    always seemed to me a little super-subtle; but it is certain that 
                    Tom’s new
                    professions did bear rather a suspicious analogy to the  old, and
                    the ferrets, and terriers, and mongrels by whom he was surrounded, 
                    “did really
                        look,” as the worthy keeper observed, “fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin.” So in 
                    good truth did Tom himself. Never
                    did any human being look more like that sort of sportsman commonly called a
                    poacher. He was a tall, finely-built man, with a prodigious stride, that cleared
                    the ground like a horse, and a power of continuing his slow and steady speed,
                    that seemed nothing less than miraculous. Neither man, nor horse, nor dog, could
                    out-tire him. He had a bold, undaunted presence, and an evident strength and
                    power of bone and muscle. You might see by looking at him, that he did not know
                    what fear meant. In his youth he had fought more battles than any man in the
                    forest. He was as if born without nerves, totally insensible to the recoils and
                    disgusts of humanity. I have known 
                    him take up a huge adder, cut off its head,
                    and then deposit the living and writhing body in his brimless hat, and walking with
                    it coiling and wreathing about his head, like another Medusa, till the sport of
                    the day was over, and he carried it home to secure the fat. With all this iron
                    stubbornness of nature, he was of a most mild and gentle demeanour, had a fine
                    placidity of countenance, and a quick blue eye beaming with good humour. His
                    face was sunburnt into one general  pale vermilion hue that
                    overspread all his features; his very hair was sunburnt too. His costume was
                    generally a smock-frock of no doubtful complexion, dirt-coloured, which hung
                    round him in tatters like fringe, rather augmenting than diminishing the
                    freedom, and, if I may so say, the gallantry of his bearing. This frock was
                    furnished with a huge inside pocket, in which to deposit the game killed by his
                    patrons—for of his three employments, that which consisted of finding hares for
                    the great farmers and small gentry, who were wont to course on the common, was
                    by far the most profitable and most pleasing to him, and to them. Every body
                    liked Tom Cordery. 
                    He had himself an aptness to like, which is almost certain to be
                    repaid in kind—the very dogs knew him, and loved him, and would beat for him
                    almost as soon as for their master. Even May, 
                    the most sagacious of greyhounds,
                    appreciated his talents, and would almost as soon listen to 
                    Tom sohoing as to old 
                    Tray
                    giving tongue.  This  human oak human oak  grew on the wild

                    most part uncultivated and uncivilised; a proper refuge for wild animals of
                    every species. Of these the most notable was my friend  Tom Cordery Tom Cordery , who
                    presented in his own person  no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived no unfit emblem of the district in which he
                        lived —the  gentlest of savages gentlest of savages , 
                    the  wildest of civilised men wildest of civilised men . He was by calling
                    rat-catcher, hare-finder, and broom-  maker; a triad of trades
                    which he had substituted for the one grand profession of poaching, which he had
                    followed in his younger days with unrivalled talent and success, and would,
                    undoubtedly, have pursued till his death, had not the bursting of an overloaded
                    gun unluckily shot off his left hand. As it was, he still contrived to mingle a
                    little of his old unlawful occupation with his honest callings; was a reference
                    of high authority amongst the young aspirants, an adviser of undoubted honour
                    and secresy—suspected, and more than suspected, as being one  “who, though he
                        played no more, o’erlooked the cards.” “who, though he
                        played no more, o’erlooked the cards.” scw: unidentifed yet  Yet he kept to windward of the law, and
                    indeed contrived to be on such terms of social and even friendly intercourse
                    with the  guardians of the game guardians of the game  on  M. Common M. Common , as may be said to prevail between
                    reputed thieves and the  myrmidons myrmidons  of justice in the neighbourhood of  Bow-street Bow-street .
                    Indeed his especial crony, the  head-keeper head-keeper , 
                    used sometimes to hint, when  Tom Tom ,
                    elevated by ale, had provoked him by overcrowing,  “that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as Tom Cordery.” “that a stump was no bad
                    shield, and that to shoot off a hand and a bit of an arm for a blind, would be
                    nothing to so daring a chap as  Tom Cordery Tom Cordery .”  This conjecture, never broached
                    till the  keeper keeper  was warm with wrath and 
                    liquor, and  Tom Tom  fairly out of hearing,
                    always seemed to me a little super-subtle; but it is certain that 
                     Tom Tom ’s new
                    professions did bear rather a suspicious analogy to the    old, and
                    the ferrets, and terriers, and mongrels by whom he was surrounded, 
                     “did really
                        look,” “did really
                        look,”  as the worthy  keeper keeper  observed,  “fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin.” “fitter to find Christian hares and
                            pheasants, than rats and such vermin.”  So in 
                    good truth did  Tom Tom  himself. Never
                    did any human being look more like that sort of sportsman commonly called a
                    poacher. He was a tall, finely-built man, with a prodigious stride, that cleared
                    the ground like a horse, and a power of continuing his slow and steady speed,
                    that seemed nothing less than miraculous. Neither man, nor horse, nor dog, could
                    out-tire him. He had a bold, undaunted presence, and an evident strength and
                    power of bone and muscle. You might see by looking at him, that he did not know
                    what fear meant. In his youth he had fought more battles than any man in the
                    forest. He was as if born without nerves, totally insensible to the recoils and
                    disgusts of humanity.  I I  have known 
                    him take up a huge adder, cut off its head,
                    and then deposit the living and writhing body in his brimless hat, and walking with
                    it coiling and wreathing about his head, like another  Medusa Medusa , till the sport of
                    the day was over, and he carried it home to secure the fat. With all this iron
                    stubbornness of nature, he was of a most mild and gentle demeanour, had a fine
                    placidity of countenance, and a quick blue eye beaming with good humour. His
                    face was sunburnt into one general    pale vermilion hue that
                    overspread all his features; his very hair was sunburnt too. His costume was
                    generally a smock-frock of no doubtful complexion, dirt-coloured, which hung
                    round him in tatters like fringe, rather augmenting than diminishing the
                    freedom, and, if I may so say, the gallantry of his bearing. This frock was
                    furnished with a huge inside pocket, in which to deposit the game killed by his
                    patrons—for of his three employments, that which consisted of finding hares for
                    the  great farmers great farmers  and  small gentry small gentry , who were wont to course on the  common common , was
                    by far the most profitable and most pleasing to him, and to them. Every body
                    liked  Tom Cordery Tom Cordery . 
                    He had himself an aptness to like, which is almost certain to be
                    repaid in kind—the very dogs knew him, and loved him, and would beat for him
                    almost as soon as for their master. Even  May May , 
                    the most sagacious of greyhounds,
                    appreciated his talents, and would almost as soon listen to 
                     Tom Tom  sohoing as to old 
                     Tray Tray scw: no idea who or what Tray is. Context suggests a keeper of greyhounds. 
                    giving tongue. 
                 Nor was his conversation less agreeable to the other part of the company.
                    Servants and masters 
                    were equally desirous to secure Tom. Besides his general
                    and professional familiarity with beasts and birds, their ways and doings, a
                    knowledge so minute and accurate, that it might have put to shame many a
                    professed naturalist, he had no small acquaintance with the goings-on of that
                    unfeathered biped called man; in short, he was,  next after Lucy,
                    who recognised his rivalry by hating, decrying, and undervaluing him, by far the
                    best news-gatherer of the country side. His news he of course picked up on the
                    civilised side of the parish, (there is no gossiping in the forest,) partly at
                    that well-frequented inn the Red Lion, 
                    of which Tom was a regular and noted
                    supporter—partly amongst his several employers, and partly by his own sagacity.
                    In the matter of marriages, (pairings he was wont to call them,) he relied
                    chiefly on his own skill in noting certain preliminary indications; and
                    certainly for a guesser by profession and a very bold one, he was astonishingly
                    often right. At the alehouse especially, he was of the first authority. An air
                    of mild importance, a diplomatic reserve on some points, great smoothness of
                    speech, and that gentleness which is so often the result of conscious power,
                    made him there an absolute ruler. Perhaps the effect of these causes might be a
                    little aided by the latent dread which that power inspired in others. Many an
                    exploit had proved that Tom Cordery’s 
                    one arm was fairly worth any two on the
                    common. The pommelling of Bob Arlott, and 
                    the levelling of Jem Serle to the

                 But he managed every body, as your gentle-mannered person is apt to do. Even the
                    rude ‘squires and rough 
                    farmers, his temporary masters, he managed, particularly
                    as far as concerned the beat, and was sure to bring them round to his own
                    peculiar fancies or prejudices, however strongly their own wishes might turn

                        place? a piece of moor land portioned out to 
                    serve for fuel to the poor of the
                    parish)—this was one. Oh the barrenness of this miserable moor! Flat, marshy,
                    dingy, bare. Here that piece of green treachery, 
                    a bog; there parched, and
                    pared, and shrivelled, and black with smoke and ashes; utterly desolate and
                    wretched every where, except where amidst the desolation blossomed, as in
                    mockery, the enamelled gentianella. 
                    No hares ever came there; they had too much
                    taste. Yet thither would Tom 
                    lead his unwary employers; thither, however warned,
                    or cautioned, or experienced, would he by reasoning or induction,
                    or gentle persuasion, or actual fraud, 
                    entice the hapless gentlemen; and then to
                    see him with his rabble of finders pacing up and down this precious
                    “sitting-ground,” (for so was Tom, thriftless liar, wont to call it,) pretending
                    to look for game, counterfeiting a meuse; forging a form; and telling a story
                    some ten years old of a famous hare once killed in that spot by his honour’s
                    favourite bitch Marygold. I never could thoroughly understand whether it were
                    design, a fear that too many hares might be killed, or a real and honest
                    mistake, a genuine prejudice in favour of the place, that influenced Tom Cordery
                    in this point. Half the one, perhaps, and half the other. Mixed motives, let
                    Pope and 
                    his disciples say what they will, are by far the commonest in this
                    parti-coloured world. Or he had shared the fate of greater men, and lied till he
                    believed—a coursing Cromwell, beginning in hypocrisy and ending in fanaticism.
                    Another pet spot was the Gallows-piece, an inclosure almost as large as the
                    Hundred Acres, where a gibbet had once borne the bodies of two murderers, with
                    the chains and bones, even in my remembrance, clanking and creaking in the wind.
                    The gibbet was gone now; but the name remained, and the feeling, deep, sad, and
                    shuddering. The place, too, 
                    was wild, awful, fearful; a heathy, furzy spot,
                    sinking into broken hollows, 
                    where murderers might lurk; a few withered pines at
                    the upper end, and  amongst them, half hidden by the brambles, the
                    stone in which the gallows had been fixed;—the bones must have been mouldering
                    beneath. All Tom’s eloquence, 
                    seconded by two capital courses, failed to drag me
                    thither a second time. But he managed every body, as your gentle-mannered person is apt to do. Even the

                    his disciples say what they will, are by far the commonest in this
                    parti-coloured world. Or he had shared the fate of greater men, and lied till he
                    believed—a coursing  Cromwell Cromwell , beginning in hypocrisy and ending in fanaticism.
                    Another pet spot was  the Gallows-piece the Gallows-piece , an inclosure almost as large as the
                     Hundred Acres Hundred Acres , where a gibbet had once borne the bodies of  two murderers two murderers , with
                    the chains and bones, even in my remembrance, clanking and creaking in the wind.
                    The gibbet was gone now; but the name remained, and the feeling, deep, sad, and
                    shuddering. The  place place , too, 
                    was wild, awful, fearful; a heathy, furzy spot,
                    sinking into  broken hollows broken hollows , 
                    where murderers might lurk; a few  withered pines withered pines  at
                    the upper end, and    amongst them, half hidden by the  brambles brambles , the
                    stone in which the gallows had been fixed;—the bones must have been mouldering
                    beneath. All  Tom Tom ’s eloquence, 
                    seconded by two capital courses, failed to drag  me me 
                    thither a second time. scw: A grad student of mine found an interesting story about hanged murderers and a Red Lion inn that might be what MRM is referencing here. Will have to consult his sources. 
                 Tom was not, however, 
                    without that strong sense of natural beauty which they who
                    live amongst the wildernesses and fastnesses of nature so often exhibit. One spot,
                    where the common trenches on the civilized world, 
                    was scarcely less his
                    admiration than mine. It is a high hill, 
                    half covered with furze, and heath, and
                    broom, and sinking abruptly down to a large pond, almost a lake, covered with
                    wild water fowl. The ground, richly clothed with wood, 
                    oak, and beech, and 
                    elm,
                    rises on the other side with equal abruptness, as if shutting in those glassy
                    waters from all but the sky, which shines so brightly in their clear bosom: just
                    in the bottom peeps a small sheltered farm, whose wreaths of light smoke and the
                    white glancing wings of the wild ducks, as they flit across the lake, are all
                    that give token of motion or of life. I 
                    have stood there in utter oblivion of
                    greyhound or of hare, till moments have swelled to minutes, and minutes to
                    hours; and so has Tom, conveying, 
                    by his exclamations of delight at its
                    “pleasantness,” exactly the same feeling 
                    which a poet or a painter (for it
                    breathes the very spirit of calm and sunshiny beauty that a master-painter
                    loves) would express by different but not truer praise. He called
                    his own home “pleasant” too; and there, 
                    though one loves to hear any home so
                    called—there, I must confess, that favourite phrase, which I like almost as well
                    as they who have no other, did seem rather misapplied. And yet it was finely
                    placed, very finely. It stood in a sort of defile, 
                    where a road almost
                    perpendicular wound from the top of a steep abrupt hill, 
                    crowned with a tuft of
                        old Scottish firs, 
                    into a dingle of fern and wild brushwood. A shallow, sullen
                            stream oozed from the bank on one side, and, after forming a rude channel across
                    the road, sank into a dark, deep pool, half hidden amongst the sallows. Behind
                    these sallows, in a nook between them and 
                    the hill, rose the uncouth and
                    shapeless cottage of Tom Cordery.  
                    It is a scene which hangs upon the eye and the
                    memory, striking, grand, almost sublime, and above all eminently foreign. No
                    English painter would choose such a subject for an English landscape; no one in
                    a picture would take it for English. It might pass for one of those scenes which
                    have furnished models to Salvator Rosa. 
                    Tom’s cottage was, however, very
                    thoroughly national and characteristic; a low, ruinous hovel, the door of which
                    was fastened with a sedulous attention to security, that contrasted strangely
                    with the tattered thatch of the roof, and the half broken windows. No garden, no
                    pigsty,  no pens for geese, none of the usual signs of cottage
                    habitation:—yet the house was covered with nondescript dwellings, and the very
                    walls were animate with their extraordinary tenants; pheasants, partridges,
                    rabbits, tame wild ducks, half tame hares, and their enemies by nature and
                    education, the ferrets, terriers, and mongrels, of whom his retinue consisted.
                    Great ingenuity had been evinced in keeping separate these jarring elements; and
                    by dint of hutches, cages, fences, kennel, and half a dozen little hurdled
                    inclosures resembling the sort of courts which children are apt to build round
                    their card-houses, peace was in general tolerably well preserved. Frequent
                    sounds, however, of fear or of anger, as their several instincts were aroused,
                    gave token that it was but a forced and hollow truce, and at such times the
                    clamour was prodigious. Tom had the 
                    remarkable tenderness for animals when
                    domesticated, which is so often found in those whose sole vocation seems to be
                    their destruction in the field; and the one long, straggling, unceiled,
                    barn-like room, which served for kitchen, bed-chamber, and hall, was cumbered
                    with bipeds and quadrupeds of all kinds and descriptions—the sick, the delicate,
                    the newly caught, the lying-in. In the midst of this menagerie sate 
                    Tom’s wife,
                    (for he was married, though without a family—married to a 
                    woman lame of a leg as
                    he himself was minus an arm,) now trying to quiet her noisy
                    inmates, now to outscold them. How long his friend 
                    the keeper would have
                    continued to wink at this den of live game, none can say: the roof fairly fell
                    in during the deep snow of last winter, killing, as poor 
                    Tom observed, two as
                    fine litters of rabbits as ever were kittened. Remotely, I have no doubt that he
                    himself fell a sacrifice to this misadventure. The 
                    overseer, to whom he applied
                    to re-instate his beloved habitation, decided that the walls would never bear
                    another roof, and removed him and his wife, 
                    as an especial favour, to a tidy,
                    snug, comfortable room in the workhouse,
                    The workhouse! From that hour poor 
                    Tom
                    visibly altered. He lost his hilarity and independence. It was a change such as
                    he had himself often inflicted, a complete change of habits, a transition from
                    the wild to the tame. No labour was demanded of him; he went about as before,
                    finding hares, killing rats, selling brooms, but the spirit of the man was
                    departed. He talked of the quiet of his old abode, and the noise of the new;
                    complained of children and other 
                    bad company; and looked down on his neighbours
                    with the sort of contempt with which a cock pheasant might regard a barn-door
                    fowl. Most of all did he, braced into a gipsey-like defiance of wet and cold,
                    grumble at the warmth and dryness of his apartment. He used to foretell that it
                    would kill him, and  assuredly it did so. Never could the typhus
                    fever have found out that wild hill side, 
                    or have lurked under that broken roof. The free touch of the air 
                    would have chased the daemon. Alas, poor Tom! 
                    warmth, and snugness,
                    and comfort, whole windows, and an entire ceiling, 
                    were the death of him. Alas, poor Tom! Tom Tom  was not, however, 
                    without that strong sense of natural beauty which they who
                    live amongst the wildernesses and fastnesses of nature so often exhibit. One spot,
