               scw: FOR EDITOR'S NOTE: MRM is referring to the 1753 Act for the Better Preventing of Clandestine Marriages (also known as the Hardwicke Marriages Act), which sought to prevent clandestine marriages by requiring that banns be posted and that the ceremony take place in a church and according to the Book of Common Prayer. The law was abolished in 1823. Ref in part: Boulton, Jeremy. "Marriage Act." Oxford Companion to British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009. Oxford Reference. Online. University of Montevallo. 
               scw: Is it the same B. as mentioned in first sketch with the stagecoach from B. to S.?
               tagged as narrator's father, or should it be something else?
               scw: FOR NOTE: MRM is referring to the story of Henry Cecil, the possibly not-quite divorced heir to the Earl of Exeter who, in 1791, disguised his identity, married Sarah Hoggins (28 June, 1773-26 December, 1797) a Shropshire farmer's daughter from Bolas Magna, lived with her for several years until the death of his uncle the Earl, and only revealed the true state of affairs upon his uncle's death in 1793. Upon assuming his title, Cecil took Sarah to live with him at his seat in Burleigh. She bore three children, and became known as the "Cottage Countess" or "Peasant Countess." She died in 1797. The story of this courtship is told in some detail a weird book published after OV: Thornton Hall, Love Romances of the Aristocracy. London: T. Werner Laurie, n.d. (accessed Project Gutenberg). Other refs: Thepeerage.com. MRM's likely source, if timing checks out, is Hazlitt's Table Talk, New Monthly Magazine, No. IV, Vol. XVII, (1822) "Burleigh House." In it, Hazlitt intimates that Sarah "never recovered" from the shock of the truth. MRM may be referring to a particular source, as the ones I've looked at don't seem to contain anything about Sarah thinking she'd married a steward. Need to check Thomas Moore's poem. Tennyson's poem, "The Lord of Burleigh," wasn't published till 1842. See Millais's illustration of the poem at Victorianweb, which turn Sarah into a romantic heroine. Nothing in ODNB. I have other notes cobbled from other places if necessary. Interesting story. See Julie Shaffer, et. al. A Noble Affair (2013).
                scw: Need to incorporate more in personography from editor's notes.
               scw: the town of B is mentioned several times here and elsewhere. Unidentified as yet.
