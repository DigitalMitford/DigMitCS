			<stage>---An Antechamber in the Ducal Palace.</stage>
			<stage><strong>Pietro</strong> speaks, in entering, to <strong>Battista</strong></stage>
			<sp><speaker>Pie.</speaker><l>Is not the messenger returned? </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Bat.</speaker><l> Not yet; </l>
				<l>I have sent frequently, as you commanded, </l>
				<l>But still the Signory is deep in council, </l>
				<l>And long debate on Steno's accusation.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Pie.</speaker><l>Too long---at least so thinks the Doge.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Bat.</speaker><l> How bears he </l>
				<l>These moments of suspense?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Pie.</speaker><l> With struggling patience. </l>
				<l>Placed at the Ducal table, covered o'er </l>
				<l>With all the apparel of the state---petitions, </l>
				<l>Despatches, judgments, acts, reprieves, reports,--- </l>
				<l>He sits as rapt in duty; but whene'er </l>
				<l>He hears the jarring of a distant door, </l>
				<l>Or aught that intimates a coming step, </l>
				<l>Or murmur of a voice, his quick eye wanders, </l>
				<l>And he will start up from his chair, then pause, </l>
				<l>And seat himself again, and fix his gaze </l>
				<l>Upon some edict; but I have observed </l>
				<l>For the last hour he has not turned a leaf.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Bat.</speaker><l>'Tis said he is much moved,---and doubtless 'twas </l>
				<l>Foul scorn in Steno to offend so grossly.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Pie.</speaker><l>Aye, if a poor man: Steno's a patrician, </l>
				<l>Young, galliard, gay, and haughty.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Bat.</speaker><l> Then you think </l>
				<l>He will not be judged hardly?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Pie.</speaker><l> 'Twere enough </l>
				<l>He be judged justly; but 'tis not for us </l>
				<l>To anticipate the sentence of the Forty.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Bat.</speaker><l>And here it comes.---What news, Vincenzo?</l></sp>
			<stage>Enter <strong>Vincenzo</strong> . </stage>
			<sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l> 'Tis </l>
				<l>Decided; but as yet his doom's unknown: </l>
				<l>I saw the President in act to seal </l>
				<l>The parchment which will bear the Forty's judgment </l> Unto the Doge, and hasten
				to inform him</sp>

			<stage><strong>Marino Faliero</strong>, Doge; and his Nephew, <strong>Bertuccio
					Faliero.</strong></stage>
			<sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>It cannot be but they will do you justice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Aye, such as the Avogadori did, </l>
				<l>Who sent up my appeal unto the Forty </l>
				<l>To try him by his peers, his own tribunal.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>His peers will scarce protect him; such an act </l>
				<l>Would bring contempt on all authority.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Know you not Venice? Know you not the Forty? </l>
				<l>But we shall see anon.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Ber. F.</l>
					<l>(addressing</l>
					<strong>Vincenzo</strong>
					<l>, then entering).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> How now---what tidings?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l>I am charged to tell his Highness that the court </l>
				<l>Has passed its resolution, and that, soon </l>
				<l>As the due forms of judgment are gone through, </l>
				<l>The sentence will be sent up to the Doge; </l>
				<l>In the mean time the Forty doth salute </l>
				<l>The Prince of the Republic, and entreat </l>
				<l>His acceptation of their duty.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Yes--- </l>
				<l>They are wond'rous dutiful, and ever humble. </l>
				<l>Sentence is passed, you say?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l> It is, your Highness: </l>
				<l>The President was sealing it, when I </l>
				<l>Was called in, that no moment might be lost </l>
				<l>In forwarding the intimation due </l>
				<l>Not only to the Chief of the Republic, </l>
				<l> But the complainant, both in one united.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Are you aware, from aught you have perceived, </l>
				<l>Of their decision?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l> No, my Lord; you know </l>
				<l>The secret custom of the courts in Venice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>True; but there still is something given to guess, </l>
				<l>Which a shrewd gleaner and quick eye would catch at; </l>
				<l>A whisper, or a murmur, or an air </l>
				<l>More or less solemn spread o'er the tribunal. </l>
				<l>The Forty are but men---most worthy men, </l>
				<l>And wise, and just, and cautious---this I grant--- </l>
				<l>And secret as the grave to which they doom </l>
				<l>The guilty: but with all this, in their aspects--- </l>
				<l>At least in some, the juniors of the number--- </l>
				<l>A searching eye, an eye like yours, Vincenzo, </l>
				<l>Would read the sentence ere it was pronounced.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l>My Lord, I came away upon the moment, </l>
				<l>And had no leisure to take note of that </l>
				<l>Which passed among the judges, even in seeming; </l>
				<l>My station near the accused too, Michel Steno, </l>
				<l>Made me---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Doge</l>
					<l>(abruptly).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l>And how looked</l>
				<em>he?</em>
				<l>deliver that.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Vin.</speaker><l>Calm, but not overcast, he stood resigned </l>
				<l>To the decree, whate'er it were;---but lo! </l>
				<l>It comes, for the perusal of his Highness.</l>
				<stage>Enter the <strong>Secretary</strong> of the Forty. </stage>
					</sp><sp><speaker>Sec.</speaker><l> The high tribunal of the Forty sends </l>
				<l>Health and respect to the Doge Faliero, </l>
				<l>Chief magistrate of Venice, and requests </l>
				<l>His Highness to peruse and to approve </l>
				<l>The sentence passed on Michel Steno, born </l>
				<l>Patrician, and arraigned upon the charge </l>
				<l>Contained, together with its penalty, </l>
				<l>Within the rescript which I now present.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Retire, and wait without.</l>
				<stage>Exeunt <strong>Secretary</strong> and <strong>Vincenzo</strong></stage>
				<l> Take thou this paper: </l>
				<l>The misty letters vanish from my eyes; </l>
				<l>I cannot fix them.</l></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Patience, my dear Uncle: </l>
				<l>Why do you tremble thus?---nay, doubt not, all </l>
				<l>Will be as could be wished.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Say on.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Ber. F.</l>
					<l>(reading).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> "Decreed </l>
				<l>In council, without one dissenting voice, </l>
				<l>That Michel Steno, by his own confession, </l>
				<l>Guilty on the last night of Carnival </l>

				<l>The following words---"</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Would'st thou

				<l>Would'st</l>

				<l>repeat them---</l>
				<em>thou</em>
				<l>, a Faliero,Harp on the deep dishonour of our house, </l>
				<l> Dishonoured in its Chief---that Chief the Prince </l>
				<l>Of Venice, first of cities?---To the sentence.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Forgive me, my good Lord; I will obey--- </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>(Reads)</speaker><l> "That Michel Steno be detained a monthIn close

			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Proceed.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> My Lord, 'tis finished.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>How say you?---finished! Do I dream?---'tis false--- </l>
				<l>Give me the paper---</l>
				<em>(snatches the paper and reads)---</em>
				<l>"'Tis decreed in councilThat Michel Steno"---Nephew, thine arm!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Nay, </l>
				<l>Cheer up, be calm; this transport is uncalled for--- </l>
				<l>Let me seek some assistance.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Stop, sir---Stir not--- </l>
				<l>'Tis past.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> I cannot but agree with you </l>
				<l>The sentence is too slight for the offence; </l>
				<l>It is not honourable in the Forty </l>
				<l>To affix so slight a penalty to that </l>
				<l>Which was a foul affront to you, and even </l>
				<l>To them, as being your subjects; but 'tis not </l>
				<l>Yet without remedy: you can appeal </l>
				<l>To them once more, or to the Avogadori, </l>
				<l>Who, seeing that true justice is withheld, </l>
				<l>Will now take up the cause they once declined, </l>
				<l> And do you right upon the bold delinquent. </l>
				<l>Think you not thus, good Uncle? why do you stand </l>
				<l>So fixed? You heed me not:---I pray you, hear me!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge</speaker><l>
					<em>(dashing down the ducal bonnet, and offering to trample upon it, exclaims,
						as he is withheld by his nephew).</em></l>
				<l>Oh! that the Saracen were in St. Mark's! </l>
				<l>Thus would I do him homage.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> For the sake </l>
				<l>Of Heaven and all its saints, my Lord---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Away! </l>
				<l>Oh, that the Genoese were in the port! </l>
				<l>Oh, that the Huns whom I o'erthrew at Zara </l>
				<l>Were ranged around the palace!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> 'Tis not well </l>
				<l>In Venice' Duke to say so.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Venice' Duke! </l>
				<l>Who now is Duke in Venice? let me see him, </l>
				<l>That he may do me right.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> If you forget </l>
				<l>Your office, and its dignity and duty, </l>
				<l>Remember that of man, and curb this passion. </l>
				<l>The Duke of Venice---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Doge</l>
					<l>(interrupting him).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> There is no such thing--- </l>
				<l>It is a word---nay, worse---a worthless by-word: </l>
				<l>The most despised, wronged, outraged, helpless wretch, </l>
				<l>Who begs his bread, if 'tis refused by one, </l>
				<l>May win it from another kinder heart; </l>
				<l> But he, who is denied his right by those </l>
				<l>Whose place it is to do no wrong, is poorer </l>
				<l>Than the rejected beggar---he's a slave--- </l>
				<l>And that am I---and thou---and all our house, </l>
				<l>Even from this hour; the meanest artisan </l>
				<l>Will point the finger, and the haughty noble </l>
				<l>May spit upon us:---where is our redress?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>The law, my Prince---</l> </sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Doge</l>
					<l>(interrupting him).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> You see what it has done; </l>
				<l>I asked no remedy but from the law--- </l>
				<l>I sought no vengeance but redress by law--- </l>
				<l>I called no judges but those named by law--- </l>
				<l>As Sovereign, I appealed unto my subjects, </l>
				<l>The very subjects who had made me Sovereign, </l>
				<l>And gave me thus a double right to be so. </l>
				<l>The rights of place and choice, of birth and service, </l>
				<l>Honours and years, these scars, these hoary hairs, </l>
				<l>The travel---toil---the perils---the fatigues--- </l>
				<l>The blood and sweat of almost eighty years, </l>
				<l>Were weighed i' the balance, 'gainst the foulest stain, </l>
				<l>The grossest insult, most contemptuous crime </l>
				<l>Of a rank, rash patrician---and found wanting! </l>
				<l>And this is to be borne!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> I say not that:--- </l>
				<l>In case your fresh appeal should be rejected, </l>
				<l> We will find other means to make all even.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Appeal again! art thou my brother's son? </l>
				<l>A scion of the house of Faliero? </l>
				<l>The nephew of a Doge? and of that blood </l>
				<l>Which hath already given three dukes to Venice? </l>
				<l>But thou say'st well---we must be humble now.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>My princely Uncle! you are too much moved;--- </l>
				<l>I grant it was a gross offence, and grossly </l>
				<l>Left without fitting punishment: but still </l>
				<l>This fury doth exceed the provocation, </l>
				<l>Or any provocation: if we are wronged, </l>
				<l>We will ask justice; if it be denied, </l>
				<l>We'll take it; but may do all this in calmness--- </l>
				<l>Deep Vengeance is the daughter of deep Silence. </l>
				<l>I have yet scarce a third part of your years, </l>
				<l>I love our house, I honour you, its Chief, </l>
				<l>The guardian of my youth, and its instructor--- </l>
				<l>But though I understand your grief, and enter </l>
				<l>In part of your disdain, it doth appal me </l>
				<l>To see your anger, like our Adrian waves, </l>
				<l>O'ersweep all bounds, and foam itself to air.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I tell thee---</l>
				<em>must</em>
				<l>I tell thee---what thy fatherWould have required no words to comprehend? </l>
				<l>Hast thou no feeling save the external sense </l>
				<l>Of torture from the touch? hast thou no soul--- </l>
				<l> No pride---no passion---no deep sense of honour?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>'Tis the first time that honour has been doubted, </l>
				<l>And were the last, from any other sceptic.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>You know the full offence of this born villain, </l>
				<l>This creeping, coward, rank, acquitted felon, </l>
				<l>Who threw his sting into a poisonous libel, </l>
				<l>And on the honour of---Oh God! my wife, </l>
				<l>The nearest, dearest part of all men's honour, </l>
				<l>Left a base slur to pass from mouth to mouth </l>
				<l>Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments, </l>
				<l>And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene; </l>
				<l>While sneering nobles, in more polished guise, </l>
				<l>Whispered the tale, and smiled upon the lie </l>
				<l>Which made me look like them---a courteous wittol, </l>
				<l>Patient---aye---proud, it may be, of dishonour.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>But still it was a lie---you knew it false, </l>
				<l>And so did all men.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Nephew, the high Roman </l>
				<l>Said, "Caesar's wife must not even be suspected," </l>
				<l>And put her from him.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> True---but in those days---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>What is it that a Roman would not suffer, </l>
				<l>That a Venetian Prince must bear? old Dandolo </l>
				<l>Refused the diadem of all the Caesars, </l>
				<l>And wore the ducal cap</l>
				<em>I</em>
				<l>trample on---</l>
				<l> Because 'tis now degraded.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> 'Tis even so.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>It is---it is;---I did not visit on </l>
				<l>The innocent creature thus most vilely slandered </l>
				<l>Because she took an old man for her lord, </l>
				<l>For that he had been long her father's friend </l>
				<l>And patron of her house, as if there were </l>
				<l>No love in woman's heart but lust of youth </l>
				<l>And beardless faces;---I did not for this </l>
				<l>Visit the villain's infamy on her, </l>
				<l>But craved my country's justice on his head, </l>
				<l>The justice due unto the humblest being </l>
				<l>Who hath a wife whose faith is sweet to him, </l>
				<l>Who hath a home whose hearth is dear to him--- </l>
				<l>Who hath a name whose honour's all to him, </l>
				<l>When these are tainted by the accursing breath </l>
				<l>Of Calumny and Scorn.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> And what redress </l>
				<l>Did you expect as his fit punishment?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Death! Was I not the Sovereign of the state--- </l>
				<l>Insulted on his very throne, and made </l>
				<l>A mockery to the men who should obey me? </l>
				<l>Was I not injured as a husband? scorned </l>
				<l>As man? reviled, degraded, as a Prince? </l>
				<l>Was not offence like his a complication </l>
				<l> Of insult and of treason?---and he lives! </l>
				<l>Had he instead of on the Doge's throne </l>
				<l>Stamped the same brand upon a peasant's stool, </l>
				<l>His blood had gilt the threshold; for the carle </l>
				<l>Had stabbed him on the instant.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Do not doubt it, </l>
				<l>He shall not live till sunset---leave to me </l>
				<l>The means, and calm yourself.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Hold, nephew: this </l>
				<l>Would have sufficed but yesterday; at present </l>
				<l>I have no further wrath against this man.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>What mean you? is not the offence redoubled </l>
				<l>By this most rank---I will not say---acquittal; </l>
				<l>For it is worse, being full acknowledgment </l>
				<l>Of the offence, and leaving it unpunished?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> It</l>
				<em>is redoubled</em>
				<l>, but not now by him:</l>
				<l>The Forty hath decreed a month's arrest--- </l>
				<l>We must obey the Forty.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Obey</l>
				<em>them!</em>Who have forgot their duty to the Sovereign?
					</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Why, yes;---boy, you perceive it then at
					last: </l>
				<l>Whether as fellow citizen who sues </l>
				<l>For justice, or as Sovereign who commands it, </l>
				<l>They have defrauded me of both my rights </l>
				<l>(For here the Sovereign is a citizen); </l>
				<l> But, notwithstanding, harm not thou a hair </l>
				<l>Of Steno's head---he shall not wear it long.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Not twelve hours longer, had you left to me </l>
				<l>The mode and means; if you had calmly heard me, </l>
				<l>I never meant this miscreant should escape, </l>
				<l>But wished you to suppress such gusts of passion, </l>
				<l>That we more surely might devise together </l>
				<l>His taking off.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> No, nephew, he must live; </l>
				<l>At least, just now---a life so vile as his </l>
				<l>Were nothing at this hour; in th' olden time </l>
				<l>Some sacrifices asked a single victim, </l>
				<l>Great expiations had a hecatomb.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Your wishes are my law: and yet I fain </l>
				<l>Would prove to you how near unto my heart </l>
				<l>The honour of our house must ever be.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Fear not; you shall have time and place of proof: </l>
				<l>But be not thou too rash, as I have been. </l>
				<l>I am ashamed of my own anger now; </l>
				<l>I pray you, pardon me.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Why, that's my uncle! </l>
				<l>The leader, and the statesman, and the chief </l>
				<l>Of commonwealths, and sovereign of himself! </l>
				<l>I wondered to perceive you so forget </l>
				<l>All prudence in your fury at these years, </l>
				<l> Although the cause---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Aye---think upon the cause--- </l>
				<l>Forget it not:---When you lie down to rest, </l>
				<l>Let it be black among your dreams; and when </l>
				<l>The morn returns, so let it stand between </l>
				<l>The Sun and you, as an ill-omened cloud </l>
				<l>Upon a summer-day of festival: </l>
				<l>So will it stand to me;---but speak not, stir not,--- </l>
				<l>Leave all to me; we shall have much to do, </l>
				<l>And you shall have a part.---But now retire, </l>
				<l>'Tis fit I were alone.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Ber. F.</l>

				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> Ere I depart, </l>
				<l>I pray you to resume what you have spurned, </l>
				<l>Till you can change it---haply, for a crown! </l>
				<l>And now I take my leave, imploring you </l>
				<l>In all things to rely upon my duty, </l>

				</speaker><l> This patron may be sounded; I will try him. </l>
				<l>I know the people to be discontented: </l>
				<l>They have cause, since Sapienza's adverse day, </l>
				<l>When Genoa conquered: they have further cause, </l>
				<l>Since they are nothing in the state, and in </l>
				<l>The city worse than nothing---mere machines, </l>
				<l>To serve the nobles' most patrician pleasure. </l>
				<l>The troops have long arrears of pay, oft promised, </l>
				<l>And murmur deeply---any hope of change </l>
				<l>Will draw them forward: they shall pay themselves </l>
				<l>With plunder:---but the priests---I doubt the priesthood </l>
				<l>Will not be with us; they have hated me </l>
				<l>Since that rash hour, when, maddened with the drone, </l>
				<l>I smote the tardy Bishop at Treviso,Quickening his holy march; yet, ne'ertheless, </l>
				<l>They may be won, at least their Chief at Rome, </l>
				<l>By some well-timed concessions; but, above </l>
				<l> All things, I must be speedy: at my hour </l>
				<l>Of twilight little light of life remains. </l>
				<l>Could I free Venice, and avenge my wrongs, </l>
				<l>I had lived too long, and willingly would sleep </l>
				<l>Next moment with my sires; and, wanting this, </l>
				<l>Better that sixty of my fourscore years </l>
				<l>Had been already where---how soon, I care not--- </l>
				<l>The whole must be extinguished;---better that </l>
				<l>They ne'er had been, than drag me on to be </l>
				<l>The thing these arch-oppressors fain would make me. </l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Of whom?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Of God and of the Doge.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Alas! my friend, you seek it of the twain </l>
				<l>Of least respect and interest in Venice. </l>
				<l>You must address the Council.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> 'Twere in vain; </l>
				<l> For he who injured me is one of them.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>There's blood upon thy face---how came it there?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>'Tis mine, and not the first I've shed for Venice, </l>
				<l>But the first shed by a Venetian hand: </l>
				<l>A noble smote me.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Doth he live?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Not long--- </l>
				<l>But for the hope I had and have, that you, </l>
				<l>My Prince, yourself a soldier, will redress </l>
				<l>Him, whom the laws of discipline and Venice </l>
				<l>Permit not to protect himself:---if not--- </l>
				<l>I say no more.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> But something you would do--- </l>
				<l>Is it not so?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I am a man, my Lord.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Why so is he who smote you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> He is called so; </l>
				<l>Nay, more, a noble one---at least, in Venice: </l>
				<l>But since he hath forgotten that I am one, </l>
				<l>And treats me like a brute, the brute may turn--- </l>
				<l>'Tis said the worm will.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Say---his name and lineage?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Barbaro.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> What was the cause? or the pretext?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>I am the chief of the arsenal, employed </l>
				<l> At present in repairing certain galleys </l>
				<l>But roughly used by the Genoese last year. </l>
				<l>This morning comes the noble Barbaro </l>
				<l>Full of reproof, because our artisans </l>
				<l>Had left some frivolous order of his house, </l>
				<l>To execute the state's decree: I dared </l>
				<l>To justify the men---he raised his hand;--- </l>
				<l>Behold my blood! the first time it e'er flowed </l>
				<l>Dishonourably.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Have you long time served?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>So long as to remember Zara's siege, </l>
				<l>And fight beneath the Chief who beat the Huns there, </l>
				<l>Sometime my general, now the Doge Faliero.---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>How! are we comrades?---the State's ducal robes </l>
				<l>Sit newly on me, and you were appointed </l>
				<l>Chief of the arsenal ere I came from Rome; </l>
				<l>So that I recognised you not. Who placed you?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>The late Doge; keeping still my old command </l>
				<l>As patron of a galley: my new office </l>
				<l>Was given as the reward of certain scars </l>
				<l>(So was your predecessor pleased to say): </l>
				<l>I little thought his bounty would conduct me </l>
				<l>To his successor as a helpless plaintiff; </l>
				<l>At least, in such a cause.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Are you much hurt?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Irreparably in my self-esteem.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Speak out; fear nothing: being stung at heart, </l>
				<l>What would you do to be revenged on this man?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>That which I dare not name, and yet will do.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Then wherefore came you here?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I come for justice, </l>
				<l>Because my general is Doge, and will not </l>
				<l>See his old soldier trampled on. Had any, </l>
				<l>Save Faliero filled the ducal throne, </l>
				<l>This blood had been washed out in other blood.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Youcome to me for justice---unto</l>
				<em>me!</em>The Doge of Venice, and I cannot give it; <l>I cannot even obtain
					it---'twas denied </l>
				<l>To me most solemnly an hour ago!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>How says your Highness?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Steno is condemned </l>
				<l>To a month's confinement.</l> </sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> What! the
					same who dared </l>
				<l>To stain the ducal throne with those foul words, </l>
				<l>That have cried shame to every ear in Venice?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Aye, doubtless they have echoed o'er the arsenal, </l>
				<l>Keeping due time with every hammer's clink, </l>
				<l>As a good jest to jolly artisans; </l>
				<l>Or making chorus to the creaking oar, </l>
				<l>In the vile tune of every galley-slave, </l>
				<l> Who, as he sung the merry stave, exulted </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>He</speaker><l> was not a shamed dotard like the Doge.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Is't possible? a month's imprisonment! </l>
				<l>No more for Steno?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> You have heard the offence, </l>
				<l>And now you know his punishment; and then </l>
				<l>You ask redress of</l>
				<em>me!</em>
				<l>Go to the Forty,Who passed the sentence upon Michel Steno; </l>
				<l>They'll do as much by Barbaro, no doubt.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Ah! dared I speak my feelings!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Give them breath. </l>
				<l>Mine have no further outrage to endure.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Then, in a word, it rests but on your word </l>
				<l>To punish and avenge---I will not say </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>My</speaker><l> petty wrong, for what is a mere blow,However vile, to
					such a thing as I am?--- </l>
				<l>But the base insult done your state and person.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>You overrate my power, which is a pageant. </l>
				<l>This Cap is not the Monarch's crown; these robes </l>
				<l>Might move compassion, like a beggar's rags; </l>
				<l>Nay, more, a beggar's are his own, and these </l>
				<l>But lent to the poor puppet, who must play </l>
				<l>Its part with all its empire in this ermine.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Wouldst thou be King?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Yes---of a happy people.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Wouldst thou be sovereign lord of Venice?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Aye, </l>
				<l>If that the people shared that sovereignty, </l>
				<l>So that nor they nor I were further slaves </l>
				<l>To this o'ergrown aristocratic Hydra, </l>
				<l>The poisonous heads of whose envenomed body </l>
				<l>Have breathed a pestilence upon us all.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Yet, thou wast born, and still hast lived,
					patrician.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>In evil hour was I so born; my birth </l>
				<l>Hath made me Doge to be insulted: but </l>
				<l>I lived and toiled a soldier and a servant </l>
				<l>Of Venice and her people, not the Senate; </l>
				<l>Their good and my own honour were my guerdon. </l>
				<l>I have fought and bled; commanded, aye, and conquered; </l>
				<l>Have made and marred peace oft in embassies, </l>
				<l>As it might chance to be our country's 'vantage; </l>
				<l>Have traversed land and sea in constant duty, </l>
				<l>Through almost sixty years, and still for Venice, </l>
				<l>My fathers' and my birthplace, whose dear spires, </l>
				<l>Rising at distance o'er the blue Lagoon, </l>
				<l>It was reward enough for me to view </l>
				<l>Once more; but not for any knot of men, </l>
				<l>Nor sect, nor faction, did I bleed or sweat! </l>
				<l>But would you know why I have done all this? </l>
				<l>Ask of the bleeding pelican why she </l>
				<l> Hath ripped her bosom? Had the bird a voice, </l>
				<l>She'd tell thee 'twas for</l>
				<em>all</em>
				<l>her little ones.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>And yet they made thee Duke.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>They made</l>
				<l>me so;I sought it not, the flattering fetters met me </l>
				<l>Returning from my Roman embassy, </l>
				<l>And never having hitherto refused </l>
				<l>Toil, charge, or duty for the state, I did not, </l>
				<l>At these late years, decline what was the highest </l>
				<l>Of all in seeming, but of all most base </l>
				<l>In what we have to do and to endure: </l>
				<l>Bear witness for me thou, my injured subject, </l>
				<l>When I can neither right myself nor thee.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>You shall do both, if you possess the will; </l>
				<l>And many thousands more not less oppressed, </l>
				<l>Who wait but for a signal---will you give it?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>You speak in riddles.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Which shall soon be read </l>
				<l>At peril of my life---if you disdain not </l>
				<l>To lend a patient ear.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Say on.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Not thou, </l>
				<l>Nor I alone, are injured and abused, </l>
				<l>Contemned and trampled on; but the whole people </l>
				<l>Groan with the strong conception of their wrongs: </l>
				<l> The foreign soldiers in the Senate's pay </l>
				<l>Are discontented for their long arrears; </l>
				<l>The native mariners, and civic troops, </l>
				<l>Feel with their friends; for who is he amongst them </l>
				<l>Whose brethren, parents, children, wives, or sisters, </l>
				<l>Have not partook oppression, or pollution, </l>
				<l>From the patricians? And the hopeless war </l>
				<l>Against the Genoese, which is still maintained </l>
				<l>With the plebeian blood, and treasure wrung </l>
				<l>From their hard earnings, has inflamed them further: </l>
				<l>Even now---but, I forget that speaking thus, </l>
				<l>Perhaps I pass the sentence of my death!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>And suffering what thou hast done---fear'st thou
					death? </l>
				<l>Be silent then, and live on, to be beaten </l>
				<l>By those for whom thou hast bled.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> No, I will speak </l>
				<l>At every hazard; and if Venice' Doge </l>
				<l>Should turn delator, be the shame on him, </l>
				<l>And sorrow too; for he will lose far more </l>
				<l>Than I.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> From me fear nothing; out with it!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Know then, that there are met and sworn in secret </l>
				<l>A band of brethren, valiant hearts and true; </l>
				<l>Men who have proved all fortunes, and have long </l>
				<l>Grieved over that of Venice, and have right </l>
				<l> To do so; having served her in all climes, </l>
				<l>And having rescued her from foreign foes, </l>
				<l>Would do the same from those within her walls. </l>
				<l>They are not numerous, nor yet too few </l>
				<l>For their great purpose; they have arms, and means, </l>
				<l>And hearts, and hopes, and faith, and patient courage.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>For what then do they pause?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> An hour to strike.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Doge</l>
					<l>(aside).</l>
				</speaker><l> Saint Mark's shall strike that hour!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I now have placed </l>
				<l>My life, my honour, all my earthly hopes </l>
				<l>Within thy power, but in the firm belief </l>
				<l>That injuries like ours, sprung from one cause, </l>
				<l>Will generate one vengeance: should it be so, </l>
				<l>Be our Chief now---our Sovereign hereafter.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>How many are ye?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I'll not answer that </l>
				<l>Till I am answered.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> How, sir! do you menace?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>No; I affirm. I have betrayed myself; </l>
				<l>But there's no torture in the mystic wells </l>
				<l>Which undermine your palace, nor in those </l>
				<l>Not less appalling cells, the "leaden roofs," </l>
				<l>To force a single name from me of others. </l>
				<l>The Pozzi and the Piombi were in vain; </l>
				<l> They might wring blood from me, but treachery never. </l>
				<l>And I would pass the fearful "Bridge of Sighs," </l>
				<l>Joyous that mine must be the last that e'er </l>
				<l>Would echo o'er the Stygian wave which flows </l>
				<l>Between the murderers and the murdered, washing </l>
				<l>The prison and the palace walls: there are </l>
				<l>Those who would live to think on't, and avenge me.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>If such your power and purpose, why come here </l>
				<l>To sue for justice, being in the course </l>
				<l>To do yourself due right?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Because the man, </l>
				<l>Who claims protection from authority, </l>
				<l>Showing his confidence and his submission </l>
				<l>To that authority, can hardly be </l>
				<l>Suspected of combining to destroy it. </l>
				<l>Had I sate down too humbly with this blow, </l>
				<l>A moody brow and muttered threats had made me </l>
				<l>A marked man to the Forty's inquisition; </l>
				<l>But loud complaint, however angrily </l>
				<l>It shapes its phrase, is little to be feared, </l>
				<l>And less distrusted. But, besides all this, </l>
				<l>I had another reason.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> What was that?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Some rumours that the Doge was greatly moved </l>
				<l>By the reference of the Avogadori </l>
				<l> Of Michel Steno's sentence to the Forty </l>
				<l>Had reached me. I had served you, honoured you, </l>
				<l>And felt that you were dangerously insulted, </l>
				<l>Being of an order of such spirits, as </l>
				<l>Requite tenfold both good and evil: 'twas </l>
				<l>My wish to prove and urge you to redress. </l>
				<l>Now you know all; and that I speak the truth, </l>
				<l>My peril be the proof.</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> You have deeply
					ventured; </l>
				<l>But all must do so who would greatly win: </l>
				<l>Thus far I'll answer you---your secret's safe.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>And is this all?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Unless with all intrusted, </l>
				<l>What would you have me answer?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I would have you </l>
				<l>Trust him who leaves his life in trust with you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>But I must know your plan, your names, and numbers; </l>
				<l>The last may then be doubled, and the former </l>
				<l>Matured and strengthened.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> We're enough already; </l>
				<l>You are the sole ally we covet now.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>But bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>That shall be done upon your formal pledge </l>
				<l>To keep the faith that we will pledge to you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>When? where?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> This night I'll bring to your apartment </l>
				<l>Two of the principals: a greater number </l>
				<l>Were hazardous.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Stay, I must think of this.--- </l>
				<l>What if I were to trust myself amongst you, </l>
				<l>And leave the palace?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> You must come alone.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>With but my nephew.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Not were he your son!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Wretch! darest thou name my son? He died in arms </l>
				<l>At Sapienza for this faithless state. </l>
				<l>Oh! that he were alive, and I in ashes! </l>
				<l>Or that he were alive ere I be ashes! </l>
				<l>I should not need the dubious aid of strangers.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Not one of all those strangers whom thou doubtest, </l>
				<l>But will regard thee with a filial feeling, </l>
				<l>So that thou keep'st a father's faith with them.</l>
					</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>The die is cast. Where is the place of
					meeting?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>At midnight I will be alone and masked </l>
				<l>Where'er your Highness pleases to direct me, </l>
				<l>To wait your coming, and conduct you where </l>
				<l>You shall receive our homage, and pronounce </l>
				<l>Upon our project.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> At what hour arises </l>
				<l>The moon?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Late, but the atmosphere is thick and dusky, </l>
				<l>'Tis a sirocco.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> At the midnight hour, then, </l>
				<l>Near to the church where sleep my sires; the same, </l>
				<l>Twin-named from the apostles John and Paul; </l>
				<l>A gondola,with one oar only, willLurk in the narrow channel which glides by. </l>

			<sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>What was the Doge's answer?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> That he was </l>
				<l>That moment summoned to a conference; </l>
				<l>But 'tis by this time ended. I perceived </l>
				<l>Not long ago the Senators embarking; </l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Would he were returned! </l>
				<l>He has been much disquieted of late; </l>
				<l>And Time, which has not tamed his fiery spirit, </l>
				<l>Nor yet enfeebled even his mortal frame, </l>
				<l>Which seems to be more nourished by a soul </l>
				<l>So quick and restless that it would consume </l>
				<l>Less hardy clay---Time has but little power </l>
				<l>On his resentments or his griefs. Unlike </l>
				<l>To other spirits of his order, who, </l>
				<l>In the first burst of passion, pour away </l>
				<l>Their wrath or sorrow, all things wear in him </l>
				<l>An aspect of Eternity: his thoughts, </l>
				<l>His feelings, passions, good or evil, all </l>
				<l>Have nothing of old age; and his bold brow </l>
				<l>Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years, </l>
				<l>Not their decrepitude: and he of late </l>
				<l> Has been more agitated than his wont. </l>

				<l>Upon his troubled spirit.</l>

				<l>But the offender doubtless even now </l>
				<l>Is doomed to expiate his rash insult with </l>
				<l>Such chastisement as will enforce respect </l>
				<l>To female virtue, and to noble blood.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>'Twas a gross insult; but I heed it not </l>
				<l>For the rash scorner's falsehood in itself, </l>
				<l>But for the effect, the deadly deep impression </l>
				<l>Which it has made upon Faliero's soul, </l>
				<l>The proud, the fiery, the austere---austere </l>
				<l>To all save me: I tremble when I think </l>
				<l>To what it may conduct.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> Assuredly </l>
				<l>The Doge can not suspect you?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Suspect</l>
				<em>me!</em>Why Steno dared not: when he scrawled his lie, <l>Grovelling by stealth
					in the moon's glimmering light, </l>
				<l>His own still conscience smote him for the act, </l>
				<l>And every shadow on the walls frowned shame </l>
				<l>Upon his coward calumny.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> 'Twere fit </l>
				<l>He should be punished grievously.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> He is so.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>What! is the sentence passed? is he condemned?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I know not that, but he has been detected.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>And deem you this enough for such foul scorn?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I would not be a judge in my own cause, </l>
				<l>Nor do I know what sense of punishment </l>
				<l>May reach the soul of ribalds such as Steno; </l>
				<l>But if his insults sink no deeper in </l>
				<l>The minds of the inquisitors than they </l>
				<l>Have ruffled mine, he will, for all acquittance, </l>
				<l>Be left to his own shamelessness or shame.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>Some sacrifice is due to slandered virtue.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Why, what is virtue if it needs a victim? </l>
				<l>Or if it must depend upon men's words? </l>
				<l>The dying Roman said, "'twas but a name:" </l>
				<l>It were indeed no more, if human breath </l>
				<l>Could make or mar it.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> Yet full many a dame, </l>
				<l>Stainless and faithful, would feel all the wrong </l>
				<l>Of such a slander; and less rigid ladies, </l>
				<l>Such as abound in Venice, would be loud </l>
				<l>And all-inexorable in their cry </l>
				<l>For justice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> This but proves it is the name </l>
				<l>And not the quality they prize: the first </l>
				<l>Have found it a hard task to hold their honour, </l>
				<l>If they require it to be blazoned forth; </l>
				<l>And those who have not kept it, seek its seeming </l>
				<l>As they would look out for an ornament </l>
				<l>Of which they feel the want, but not because </l>
				<l>They think it so; they live in others' thoughts, </l>
				<l>And would seem honest as they must seem fair.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>You have strange thoughts for a patrician dame.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>And yet they were my father's; with his name, </l>
				<l>The sole inheritance he left.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> You want none; </l>
				<l>Wife to a Prince, the Chief of the Republic.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I should have sought none though a peasant's bride, </l>
				<l>But feel not less the love and gratitude </l>
				<l>Due to my father, who bestowed my hand </l>
				<l>Upon his early, tried, and trusted friend, </l>
				<l>The Count Val di Marino, now our Doge.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>And with that hand did he bestow your heart?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>He did so, or it had not been bestowed.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>Yet this strange disproportion in your years, </l>
				<l>And, let me add, disparity of tempers, </l>
				<l>Might make the world doubt whether such an union </l>
				<l>Could make you wisely, permanently happy.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> The world will think with worldlings; but my heart </l>
				<l>Has still been in my duties, which are many, </l>
				<l>But never difficult.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> And do you love him?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I love all noble qualities which merit </l>
				<l>Love, and I loved my father, who first taught me </l>
				<l>To single out what we should love in others, </l>
				<l>And to subdue all tendency to lend </l>
				<l>The best and purest feelings of our nature </l>
				<l>To baser passions. He bestowed my hand </l>
				<l>Upon Faliero: he had known him noble, </l>
				<l>Brave, generous; rich in all the qualities </l>
				<l>Of soldier, citizen, and friend; in all </l>
				<l>Such have I found him as my father said. </l>
				<l>His faults are those that dwell in the high bosoms </l>
				<l>Of men who have commanded; too much pride, </l>
				<l>And the deep passions fiercely fostered by </l>
				<l>The uses of patricians, and a life </l>
				<l>Spent in the storms of state and war; and also </l>
				<l>From the quick sense of honour, which becomes </l>
				<l>A duty to a certain sign, a vice </l>
				<l>When overstrained, and this I fear in him. </l>
				<l>And then he has been rash from his youth upwards, </l>
				<l>Yet tempered by redeeming nobleness </l>
				<l>In such sort, that the wariest of republics </l>
				<l> Has lavished all its chief employs upon him, </l>
				<l>From his first fight to his last embassy, </l>
				<l>From which on his return the Dukedom met him.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>But previous to this marriage, had your heart </l>
				<l>Ne'er beat for any of the noble youth, </l>
				<l>Such as in years had been more meet to match </l>
				<l>Beauty like yours? or, since, have you ne'er seen </l>
				<l>One, who, if your fair hand were still to give, </l>
				<l>Might now pretend to Loredano's daughter?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I answered your first question when I said </l>
				<l>I married.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> And the second?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Needs no answer.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>I pray you pardon, if I have offended.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I feel no wrath, but some surprise: I knew not </l>
				<l>That wedded bosoms could permit themselves </l>
				<l>To ponder upon what they</l>
				<em>now</em>
				<l>might choose,Or aught save their past choice.</l>
					</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l> 'Tis their past choice </l>
				<l>That far too often makes them deem they would </l>
				<l>Now choose more wisely, could they cancel it.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>It may be so. I knew not of such thoughts.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker><l>Here comes the Doge---shall I retire?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> It may </l>
				<l>Be better you should quit me; he seems rapt </l> In thought.---How pensively he
				takes his way! <em>

				<l>Now in the Arsenal, who holds command </l>

				<l>Besides on all the spirits of his comrades: </l>
				<l>This man, I hear, is bold and popular, </l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> My Lord!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>My dearest child, forgive me---why delay </l>
				<l>So long approaching me?---I saw you not.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>You were absorbed in thought, and he who now </l>
				<l>Has parted from you might have words of weight </l>
				<l>To bear you from the Senate.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> From the Senate?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I would not interrupt him in his duty </l>
				<l> And theirs.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> The Senate's duty! you mistake; </l>
				<l>'Tis we who owe all service to the Senate.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I thought the Duke had held command in Venice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>He shall.---But let that pass.---We will be jocund. </l>
				<l>How fares it with you? have you been abroad? </l>
				<l>The day is overcast, but the calm wave </l>
				<l>Favours the gondolier's light skimming oar; </l>
				<l>Or have you held a levee of your friends? </l>
				<l>Or has your music made you solitary? </l>
				<l>Say---is there aught that you would will within </l>
				<l>The little sway now left the Duke? or aught </l>
				<l>Of fitting splendour, or of honest pleasure, </l>
				<l>Social or lonely, that would glad your heart, </l>
				<l>To compensate for many a dull hour, wasted </l>
				<l>On an old man oft moved with many cares? </l>
				<l>Speak, and 'tis done.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> You're ever kind to me. </l>
				<l>I have nothing to desire, or to request, </l>
				<l>Except to see you oftener and calmer.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Calmer?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Aye, calmer, my good Lord.---Ah, why </l>
				<l>Do you still keep apart, and walk alone, </l>
				<l>And let such strong emotions stamp your brow, </l>
				<l>As not betraying their full import, yet </l>
				<l> Disclose too much?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Disclose too much!---of what? </l>
				<l>What is there to disclose?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> A heart so ill </l>
				<l>At ease.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> 'Tis nothing, child.---But in the state </l>
				<l>You know what daily cares oppress all those </l>
				<l>Who govern this precarious commonwealth; </l>
				<l>Now suffering from the Genoese without, </l>
				<l>And malcontents within---'tis this which makes me </l>
				<l>More pensive and less tranquil than my wont.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Yet this existed long before, and never </l>
				<l>Till in these late days did I see you thus. </l>
				<l>Forgive me; there is something at your heart </l>
				<l>More than the mere discharge of public duties, </l>
				<l>Which long use and a talent like to yours </l>
				<l>Have rendered light, nay, a necessity, </l>
				<l>To keep your mind from stagnating. 'Tis not </l>
				<l>In hostile states, nor perils, thus to shake you,--- </l>
				<l>You, who have stood all storms and never sunk, </l>
				<l>And climbed up to the pinnacle of power </l>
				<l>And never fainted by the way, and stand </l>
				<l>Upon it, and can look down steadily </l>
				<l>Along the depth beneath, and ne'er feel dizzy. </l>
				<l>Were Genoa's galleys riding in the port, </l>
				<l> Were civil fury raging in Saint Mark's, </l>
				<l>You are not to be wrought on, but would fall, </l>
				<l>As you have risen, with an unaltered brow: </l>
				<l>Your feelings now are of a different kind; </l>
				<l>Something has stung your pride, not patriotism.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Pride! Angiolina? Alas! none is left me.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Yes---the same sin that overthrew the angels, </l>
				<l>And of all sins most easily besets </l>
				<l>Mortals the nearest to the angelic nature: </l>
				<l>The vile are only vain; the great are proud.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I</l>
				<em>had</em>
				<l>the pride of honour, of</l>
				<em>your</em>
				<l>honour,Deep at my heart--- But let us change the theme.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Ah no!---As I have ever shared your kindness </l>
				<l>In all things else, let me not be shut out </l>
				<l>From your distress: were it of public import, </l>
				<l>You know I never sought, would never seek </l>
				<l>To win a word from you; but feeling now </l>
				<l>Your grief is private, it belongs to me </l>
				<l>To lighten or divide it. Since the day </l>
				<l>When foolish Steno's ribaldry detected </l>
				<l>Unfixed your quiet, you are greatly changed, </l>
				<l>And I would soothe you back to what you were.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>To what I was!---have you heard Steno's
					sentence?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>No.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> A month's arrest.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Is it not enough?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Enough!---yes, for a drunken galley slave, </l>
				<l>Who, stung by stripes, may murmur at his master; </l>
				<l>But not for a deliberate, false, cool villain, </l>
				<l>Who stains a Lady's and a Prince's honour </l>
				<l>Even on the throne of his authority.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>There seems to be enough in the conviction </l>
				<l>Of a patrician guilty of a falsehood: </l>
				<l>All other punishment were light unto </l>
				<l>His loss of honour.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Such men have no honour; </l>
				<l>They have but their vile lives---and these are spared.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>You would not have him die for this offence?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Not</l>
				<em>now</em>
				<l>:---being still alive, I'd have him live</l>
				<l>Long as</l>
				<em>he</em>
				<l>can; he has ceased to merit death;The guilty saved hath damned his hundred
					judges, </l>
				<l>And he is pure, for now his crime is theirs.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Oh! had this false and flippant libeller </l>
				<l>Shed his young blood for his absurd lampoon, </l>
				<l>Ne'er from that moment could this breast have known </l>
				<l>A joyous hour, or dreamless slumber more.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Does not the law of Heaven say blood for blood? </l>
				<l>And he who</l>
				<em>taints</em>
				<l>kills more than he who sheds it.</l>
				<l>Is it the</l>
				<em>pain</em>
				<l>of blows, or</l>
				<em>shame</em>
				<l>of blows,That makes such deadly to the sense of man? </l>
				<l> Do not the laws of man say blood for honour,--- </l>
				<l>And, less than honour, for a little gold? </l>
				<l>Say not the laws of nations blood for treason? </l>
				<l>Is't nothing to have filled these veins with poison </l>
				<l>For their once healthful current? is it nothing </l>
				<l>To have stained your name and mine---the noblest names? </l>
				<l>Is't nothing to have brought into contempt </l>
				<l>A Prince before his people? to have failed </l>
				<l>In the respect accorded by Mankind </l>
				<l>To youth in woman, and old age in man? </l>
				<l>To virtue in your sex, and dignity </l>
				<l>In ours?---But let them look to it who have saved him.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Heaven bids us to forgive our enemies.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Doth Heaven forgive her own? Is there not Hell </l>
				<l>For wrath eternal?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Do not speak thus wildly--- </l>
				<l>Heaven will alike forgive you and your foes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Amen! May Heaven forgive them!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> And will you?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Yes, when they are in Heaven!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> And not till then?</l>
					</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>What matters my forgiveness? an old man's, </l>
				<l>Worn out, scorned, spurned, abused; what matters then </l>
				<l>My pardon more than my resentment, both </l>
				<l>Being weak and worthless? I have lived too long; </l>
				<l> But let us change the argument.---My child! </l>
				<l>My injured wife, the child of Loredano, </l>
				<l>The brave, the chivalrous, how little deemed </l>
				<l>Thy father, wedding thee unto his friend, </l>
				<l>That he was linking thee to shame!---Alas! </l>
				<l>Shame without sin, for thou art faultless. Hadst thou </l>
				<l>But had a different husband,</l>
				<em>any</em>
				<l>husbandIn Venice save the Doge, this blight, this brand, </l>
				<l>This blasphemy had never fallen upon thee. </l>
				<l>So young, so beautiful, so good, so pure, </l>
				<l>To suffer this, and yet be unavenged!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>I am too well avenged, for you still love me, </l>
				<l>And trust, and honour me; and all men know </l>
				<l>That you are just, and I am true: what more </l>
				<l>Could I require, or you command?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> 'Tis well, </l>
				<l>And may be better; but whate'er betide, </l>
				<l>Be thou at least kind to my memory.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Why speak you thus?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> It is no matter why; </l>
				<l>But I would still, whatever others think, </l>
				<l>Have your respect both now and in my grave.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Why should you doubt it? has it ever failed?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Come hither, child! I would a word with you. </l>
				<l>Your father was my friend; unequal Fortune </l>
				<l> Made him my debtor for some courtesies </l>
				<l>Which bind the good more firmly: when oppressed </l>
				<l>With his last malady, he willed our union, </l>
				<l>It was not to repay me, long repaid </l>
				<l>Before by his great loyalty in friendship; </l>
				<l>His object was to place your orphan beauty </l>
				<l>In honourable safety from the perils, </l>
				<l>Which, in this scorpion nest of vice, assail </l>
				<l>A lonely and undowered maid. I did not </l>
				<l>Think with him, but would not oppose the thought </l>
				<l>Which soothed his death-bed.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> I have not forgotten </l>
				<l>The nobleness with which you bade me speak </l>
				<l>If my young heart held any preference </l>
				<l>Which would have made me happier; nor your offer </l>
				<l>To make my dowry equal to the rank. </l>
				<l>Of aught in Venice, and forego all claim </l>
				<l>My father's last injunction gave you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Thus, </l>
				<l>'Twas not a foolish dotard's vile caprice, </l>
				<l>Nor the false edge of ag√©d appetite, </l>
				<l>Which made me covetous of girlish beauty, </l>
				<l>And a young bride: for in my fieriest youth </l>
				<l>I swayed such passions; nor was this my age </l>
				<l>Infected with that leprosy of lust </l>
				<l> Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men, </l>
				<l>Making them ransack to the very last </l>
				<l>The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys; </l>
				<l>Or buy in selfish marriage some young victim, </l>
				<l>Too helpless to refuse a state that's honest, </l>
				<l>Too feeling not to know herself a wretch. </l>
				<l>Our wedlock was not of this sort; you had </l>
				<l>Freedom from me to choose, and urged in answer </l>
				<l>Your father's choice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> I did so; I would do so </l>
				<l>In face of earth and Heaven; for I have never </l>
				<l>Repented for my sake; sometimes for yours, </l>
				<l>In pondering o'er your late disquietudes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I knew my heart would never treat you harshly; </l>
				<l>I knew my days could not disturb you long; </l>
				<l>And then the daughter of my earliest friend, </l>
				<l>His worthy daughter, free to choose again, </l>
				<l>Wealthier and wiser, in the ripest bloom </l>
				<l>Of womanhood, more skilful to select </l>
				<l>By passing these probationary years, </l>
				<l>Inheriting a Prince's name and riches, </l>
				<l>Secured, by the short penance of enduring </l>
				<l>An old man for some summers, against all </l>
				<l>That law's chicane or envious kinsmen might </l>
				<l>Have urged against her right; my best friend's child </l>
				<l> Would choose more fitly in respect of years, </l>
				<l>And not less truly in a faithful heart.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>My Lord, I looked but to my father's wishes, </l>
				<l>Hallowed by his last words, and to my heart </l>
				<l>For doing all its duties, and replying </l>
				<l>With faith to him with whom I was affianced. </l>
				<l>Ambitious hopes ne'er crossed my dreams; and should </l>
				<l>The hour you speak of come, it will be seen so.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I do believe you; and I know you true: </l>
				<l>For Love---romantic Love---which in my youth </l>
				<l>I knew to be illusion, and ne'er saw </l>
				<l>Lasting, but often fatal, it had been </l>
				<l>No lure for me, in my most passionate days, </l>
				<l>And could not be so now, did such exist. </l>
				<l>But such respect, and mildly paid regard </l>
				<l>As a true feeling for your welfare, and </l>
				<l>A free compliance with all honest wishes,--- </l>
				<l>A kindness to your virtues, watchfulness </l>
				<l>Not shown, but shadowing o'er such little failings </l>
				<l>As Youth is apt in, so as not to check </l>
				<l>Rashly, but win you from them ere you knew </l>
				<l>You had been won, but thought the change your choice; </l>
				<l>A pride not in your beauty, but your conduct; </l>
				<l>A trust in you; a patriarchal love, </l>
				<l>And not a doting homage; friendship, faith,--- </l>
				<l> Such estimation in your eyes as these </l>
				<l>Might claim, I hoped for.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> And have ever had.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I think so. For the difference in our years </l>
				<l>You knew it choosing me, and chose; I trusted </l>
				<l>Not to my qualities, nor would have faith </l>
				<l>In such, nor outward ornaments of nature, </l>
				<l>Were I still in my five and twentieth spring; </l>
				<l>I trusted to the blood of Loredano </l>
				<l>Pure in your veins; I trusted to the soul </l>
				<l>God gave you---to the truths your father taught you--- </l>
				<l>To your belief in Heaven---to your mild virtues--- </l>
				<l>To your own faith and honour, for my own.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>You have done well.---I thank you for that trust, </l>
				<l>Which I have never for one moment ceased </l>
				<l>To honour you the more for.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Where is Honour, </l>
				<l>Innate and precept-strengthened, 'tis the rock </l>
				<l>Of faith connubial: where it is not---where </l>
				<l>Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities </l>
				<l>Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart, </l>
				<l>Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know </l>
				<l>'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream </l>
				<l>Of honesty in such infected blood, </l>
				<l>Although 'twere wed to him it covets most: </l>
				<l> An incarnation of the poet's God </l>
				<l>In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or </l>
				<l>The demi-deity, Alcides, in </l>
				<l>His majesty of superhuman Manhood, </l>
				<l>Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not; </l>
				<l>It is consistency which forms and proves it: </l>
				<l>Vice cannot fix, and Virtue cannot change. </l>
				<l>The once fall'n woman must for ever fall; </l>
				<l>For Vice must have variety, while Virtue </l>
				<l>Stands like the Sun, and all which rolls around </l>
				<l>Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>And seeing, feeling thus this truth in others, </l>
				<l>(I pray you pardon me;) but wherefore yield you </l>
				<l>To the most fierce of fatal passions, and </l>
				<l>Disquiet your great thoughts with restless hate </l>
				<l>Of such a thing as Steno?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> You mistake me. </l>
				<l>It is not Steno who could move me thus; </l>
				<l>Had it been so, he should---but let that pass.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>What is't you feel so deeply, then, even now?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>The violated majesty of Venice, </l>
				<l>At once insulted in her Lord and laws.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Alas! why will you thus consider it?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I have thought on't till---but let me lead you back </l>
				<l>To what I urged; all these things being noted, </l>
				<l> I wedded you; the world then did me justice </l>
				<l>Upon the motive, and my conduct proved </l>
				<l>They did me right, while yours was all to praise: </l>
				<l>You had all freedom---all respect---all trust </l>
				<l>From me and mine; and, born of those who made </l>
				<l>Princes at home, and swept Kings from their thrones </l>
				<l>On foreign shores, in all things you appeared </l>
				<l>Worthy to be our first of native dames.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>To what does this conduct?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> To thus much---that </l>
				<l>A miscreant's angry breath may blast it all--- </l>
				<l>A villain, whom for his unbridled bearing, </l>
				<l>Even in the midst of our great festival, </l>
				<l>I caused to be conducted forth, and taught </l>
				<l>How to demean himself in ducal chambers; </l>
				<l>A wretch like this may leave upon the wall </l>
				<l>The blighting venom of his sweltering heart, </l>
				<l>And this shall spread itself in general poison; </l>
				<l>And woman's innocence, man's honour, pass </l>
				<l>Into a by-word; and the doubly felon </l>
				<l>(Who first insulted virgin modesty </l>
				<l>By a gross affront to your attendant damsels </l>
				<l>Amidst the noblest of our dames in public) </l>
				<l>Requite himself for his most just expulsion </l>
				<l>By blackening publicly his Sovereign's consort, </l>
				<l> And be absolved by his upright compeers.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>But he has been condemned into captivity.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>For such as him a dungeon were acquittal; </l>
				<l>And his brief term of mock-arrest will pass </l>
				<l>Within a palace. But I've done with him; </l>
				<l>The rest must be with you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> With me, my Lord?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Yes, Angiolina. Do not marvel; I </l>
				<l>Have let this prey upon me till I feel </l>
				<l>My life cannot be long; and fain would have you </l>
				<l>Regard the injunctions you will find within </l>
				<l>This scroll</l>
				<em>(giving her a paper)</em>
				<l>---Fear not; they are for your advantage:Read them hereafter at the fitting
					hour.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>My Lord, in life, and after life, you shall </l>
				<l>Be honoured still by me: but may your days </l>
				<l>Be many yet---and happier than the present! </l>
				<l>This passion will give way, and you will be </l>
				<l>Serene, and what you should be---what you were.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I will be what I should be, or be nothing; </l>
				<l>But never more---oh! never, never more, </l>
				<l>O'er the few days or hours which yet await </l>
				<l>The blighted old age of Faliero, shall </l>
				<l>Sweet Quiet shed her sunset! Never more </l>
				<l>Those summer shadows rising from the past </l>
				<l>Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life, </l>
				<l> Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches, </l>
				<l>Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest. </l>
				<l>I had but little more to ask, or hope, </l>
				<l>Save the regards due to the blood and sweat, </l>
				<l>And the soul's labour through which I had toiled </l>
				<l>To make my country honoured. As her servant--- </l>
				<l>Her servant, though her chief---I would have gone </l>
				<l>Down to my fathers with a name serene </l>
				<l>And pure as theirs; but this has been denied me. </l>
				<l>Would I had died at Zara!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> There you saved </l>
				<l>The state; then live to save her still. A day, </l>
				<l>Another day like that would be the best </l>
				<l>Reproof to them, and sole revenge for you.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>But one such day occurs within an age; </l>
				<l>My life is little less than one, and 'tis </l>
				<l>Enough for Fortune to have granted</l>
				<em>once</em>
				<l>,That which scarce one more favoured citizen </l>
				<l>May win in many states and years. But why </l>
				<l>Thus speak I? Venice has forgot that day--- </l>
				<l>Then why should I remember it?---Farewell, </l>
				<l>Sweet Angiolina! I must to my cabinet; </l>
				<l>There's much for me to do---and the hour hastens.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Remember what you were.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> It were in vain! </l>
				<l> Joy's recollection is no longer joy, </l>
				<l>While Sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>At least, whate'er may urge, let me implore </l>
				<l>That you will take some little pause of rest: </l>
				<l>Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid, </l>
				<l>That it had been relief to have awaked you, </l>
				<l>Had I not hoped that Nature would o'erpower </l>
				<l>At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus. </l>
				<l>An hour of rest will give you to your toils </l>
				<l>With fitter thoughts and freshened strength.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I cannot--- </l>
				<l>I must not, if I could; for never was </l>
				<l>Such reason to be watchful: yet a few--- </l>
				<l>Yet a few days and dream-perturb√©d nights, </l>
				<l>And I shall slumber well---but where?---no matter. </l>
				<l>Adieu, my Angiolina.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Let me be </l>
				<l>An instant---yet an instant your companion! </l>
				<l>I cannot bear to leave you thus.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Come then, </l>
				<l>My gentle child---forgive me: thou wert made </l>
				<l>For better fortunes than to share in mine, </l>
				<l>Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale </l>
				<l>Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow. </l>
				<l>When I am gone---it may be sooner than </l>
				<l> Even these years warrant, for there is that stirring </l>
				<l>Within---above---around, that in this city </l>
				<l>Will make the cemeteries populous </l>
				<l>As e'er they were by pestilence or war,--- </l>
				<l>When I</l>
				<em>am</em>
				<l>nothing, let that which I</l>
				<em>was</em>Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips, <l>A shadow in thy fancy,
					of a thing </l>
				<l>Which would not have thee mourn it, but remember. </l>
				<l>Let us begone, my child---the time is pressing.</l></sp></div>

			<stage>---A retired spot near the Arsenal.</stage>
			<stage><strong>Israel Bertuccio</strong> and <strong>Philip Calendaro</strong></stage>
			<sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>How sped you, Israel, in your late complaint?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Why, well.</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>
					Is't possible! will he be punished?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Yes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>With what? a mulct or an arrest?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> With death!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Now you rave, or must intend revenge, </l>
				<l>Such as I counselled you, with your own hand.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Yes; and for one sole draught of hate, forego </l>
				<l>The great redress we meditate for Venice, </l>
				<l>And change a life of hope for one of exile; </l>
				<l>Leaving one scorpion crushed, and thousands stinging </l>
				<l>My friends, my family, my countrymen! </l>
				<l>No, Calendaro; these same drops of blood, </l>
				<l>Shed shamefully, shall have the whole of his </l>
				<l>For their requital---But not only his; </l>
				<l>We will not strike for private wrongs alone: </l>
				<l>Such are for selfish passions and rash men, </l>
				<l>But are unworthy a Tyrannicide.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>You have more patience than I care to boast. </l>
				<l>Had I been present when you bore this insult, </l>
				<l>I must have slain him, or expired myself </l>
				<l>In the vain effort to repress my wrath.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Thank Heaven you were not---all had else been
					marred: </l>
				<l> As 'tis, our cause looks prosperous still.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> You saw </l>
				<l>The Doge---what answer gave he?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> That there was </l>
				<l>No punishment for such as Barbaro.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>I told you so before, and that 'twas idle </l>
				<l>To think of justice from such hands.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> At least, </l>
				<l>It lulled suspicion, showing confidence. </l>
				<l>Had I been silent, not a Sbirro but </l>
				<l>Had kept me in his eye, as meditating </l>
				<l>A silent, solitary, deep revenge.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>But wherefore not address you to the Council? </l>
				<l>The Doge is a mere puppet, who can scarce </l>
				<l>Obtain right for himself. Why speak to</l>
				<em>him?</em>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>You shall know that hereafter.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Why not now?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Be patient but till midnight. Get your musters, </l>
				<l>And bid our friends prepare their companies: </l>
				<l>Set all in readiness to strike the blow, </l>
				<l>Perhaps in a few hours: we have long waited </l>
				<l>For a fit time---that hour is on the dial, </l>
				<l>It may be, of to-morrow's sun: delay </l>
				<l>Beyond may breed us double danger. See </l>
				<l>That all be punctual at our place of meeting, </l>
				<l> And armed, excepting those of the Sixteen, </l>
				<l>Who will remain among the troops to wait </l>
				<l>The signal.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> These brave words have breathed new life </l>
				<l>Into my veins; I am sick of these protracted </l>
				<l>And hesitating councils: day on day </l>
				<l>Crawled on, and added but another link </l>
				<l>To our long fetters, and some fresher wrong </l>
				<l>Inflicted on our brethren or ourselves, </l>
				<l>Helping to swell our tyrants' bloated strength. </l>
				<l>Let us but deal upon them, and I care not </l>
				<l>For the result, which must be Death or Freedom! </l>
				<l>I'm weary to the heart of finding neither.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>We will be free in Life or Death! the grave </l>
				<l>Is chainless. Have you all the musters ready? </l>
				<l>And are the sixteen companies completed </l>
				<l>To sixty?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> All save two, in which there are </l>
				<l>Twenty-five wanting to make up the number.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>No matter; we can do without. Whose are they?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Bertram's and old Soranzo's, both of whom </l>
				<l>Appear less forward in the cause than we are.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Your fiery nature makes you deem all those </l>
				<l>Who are not restless cold; but there exists </l>
				<l>Oft in concentred spirits not less daring </l>
				<l> Than in more loud avengers. Do not doubt them.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>I do not doubt the elder; but in Bertram </l>
				<l>There is a hesitating softness, fatal </l>
				<l>To enterprise like ours: I've seen that man </l>
				<l>Weep like an infant o'er the misery </l>
				<l>Of others, heedless of his own, though greater; </l>
				<l>And in a recent quarrel I beheld him </l>
				<l>Turn sick at sight of blood, although a villain's.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>The truly brave are soft of heart and eyes, </l>
				<l>And feel for what their duty bids them do. </l>
				<l>I have known Bertram long; there doth not breathe </l>
				<l>A soul more full of honour.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> It may be so: </l>
				<l>I apprehend less treachery than weakness; </l>
				<l>Yet as he has no mistress, and no wife </l>
				<l>To work upon his milkiness of spirit, </l>
				<l>He may go through the ordeal; it is well </l>
				<l>He is an orphan, friendless save in us: </l>
				<l>A woman or a child had made him less </l>
				<l>Than either in resolve.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Such ties are not </l>
				<l>For those who are called to the high destinies </l>
				<l>Which purify corrupted commonwealths; </l>
				<l>We must forget all feelings save the</l>
				<em>one</em>
				<l>,We must resign all passions save our purpose, </l>
				<l> We must behold no object save our country, </l>
				<l>And only look on Death as beautiful, </l>
				<l>So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven, </l>
				<l>And draw down Freedom on her evermore.</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>But
					if we fail---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> They never fail who die </l>
				<l>In a great cause: the block may soak their gore: </l>
				<l>Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs </l>
				<l>Be strung to city gates and castle walls--- </l>
				<l>But still their Spirit walks abroad. Though years </l>
				<l>Elapse, and others share as dark a doom, </l>
				<l>They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts </l>
				<l>Which overpower all others, and conduct </l>
				<l>The world at last to Freedom. What were we, </l>
				<l>If Brutus had not lived? He died in giving </l>
				<l>Rome liberty, but left a deathless lesson--- </l>
				<l>A name which is a virtue, and a Soul </l>
				<l>Which multiplies itself throughout all time, </l>
				<l>When wicked men wax mighty, and a state </l>
				<l>Turns servile. He and his high friend were styled </l>
				<l>"The last of Romans!" Let us be the first </l>
				<l>Of true Venetians, sprung from Roman sires.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Our fathers did not fly from Attila </l>
				<l>Into these isles, where palaces have sprung </l>
				<l>On banks redeemed from the rude ocean's ooze, </l>
				<l> To own a thousand despots in his place. </l>
				<l>Better bow down before the Hun, and call </l>
				<l>A Tartar lord, than these swoln silkworms masters! </l>
				<l>The first at least was man, and used his sword </l>
				<l>As sceptre: these unmanly creeping things </l>
				<l>Command our swords, and rule us with a word </l>
				<l>As with a spell.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> It shall be broken soon. </l>
				<l>You say that all things are in readiness; </l>
				<l>To-day I have not been the usual round, </l>
				<l>And why thou knowest; but thy vigilance </l>
				<l>Will better have supplied my care: these orders </l>
				<l>In recent council to redouble now </l>
				<l>Our efforts to repair the galleys, have </l>
				<l>Lent a fair colour to the introduction </l>
				<l>Of many of our cause into the arsenal, </l>
				<l>As new artificers for their equipment, </l>
				<l>Or fresh recruits obtained in haste to man </l>
				<l>The hoped-for fleet.---Are all supplied with arms?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>All who were deemed trust-worthy: there are some </l>
				<l>Whom it were well to keep in ignorance </l>
				<l>Till it be time to strike, and then supply them; </l>
				<l>When in the heat and hurry of the hour </l>
				<l>They have no opportunity to pause, </l>
				<l>But needs must on with those who will surround them.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> You have said well. Have you remarked all
					such?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>I've noted most; and caused the other chiefs </l>
				<l>To use like caution in their companies. </l>
				<l>As far as I have seen, we are enough </l>
				<l>To make the enterprise secure, if 'tis </l>
				<l>Commenced to-morrow; but, till 'tis begun, </l>
				<l>Each hour is pregnant with a thousand perils.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Let the Sixteen meet at the wonted hour, </l>
				<l>Except Soranzo, Nicoletto Blondo, </l>
				<l>And Marco Giuda, who will keep their watch </l>
				<l>Within the arsenal, and hold all ready, </l>
				<l>Expectant of the signal we will fix on.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>We will not fail.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Let all the rest be there; </l>
				<l>I have a stranger to present to them.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>A stranger! doth he know the secret?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Yes.</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>And
					have you dared to peril your friends' lives </l>
				<l>On a rash confidence in one we know not?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>I have risked no man's life except my own--- </l>
				<l>Of that be certain: he is one who may </l>
				<l>Make our assurance doubly sure, according </l>
				<l>His aid; and if reluctant, he no less </l>
				<l>Is in our power: he comes alone with me, </l>
				<l>And cannot 'scape us; but he will not swerve.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> I cannot judge of this until I know him: </l>
				<l>Is he one of our order?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Aye, in spirit, </l>
				<l>Although a child of Greatness; he is one </l>
				<l>Who would become a throne, or overthrow one--- </l>
				<l>One who has done great deeds, and seen great changes; </l>
				<l>No tyrant, though bred up to tyranny; </l>
				<l>Valiant in war, and sage in council; noble </l>
				<l>In nature, although haughty; quick, yet wary: </l>
				<l>Yet for all this, so full of certain passions, </l>
				<l>That if once stirred and baffled, as he has been </l>
				<l>Upon the tenderest points, there is no Fury </l>
				<l>In Grecian story like to that which wrings </l>
				<l>His vitals with her burning hands, till he </l>
				<l>Grows capable of all things for revenge; </l>
				<l>And add too, that his mind is liberal, </l>
				<l>He sees and feels the people are oppressed, </l>
				<l>And shares their sufferings. Take him all in all, </l>
				<l>We have need of such, and such have need of us.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>And what part would you have him take with us?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>It may be, that of Chief.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> What! and resign </l>
				<l>Your own command as leader?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Even so. </l>
				<l>My object is to make your cause end well, </l>
				<l> And not to push myself to power. Experience, </l>
				<l>Some skill, and your own choice, had marked me out </l>
				<l>To act in trust as your commander, till </l>
				<l>Some worthier should appear: if I have found such </l>
				<l>As you yourselves shall own more worthy, think you </l>
				<l>That I would hesitate from selfishness, </l>
				<l>And, covetous of brief authority, </l>
				<l>Stake our deep interest on my single thoughts, </l>
				<l>Rather than yield to one above me in </l>
				<l>All leading qualities? No, Calendaro, </l>
				<l>Know your friend better; but you all shall judge. </l>
				<l>Away! and let us meet at the fixed hour. </l>
				<l>Be vigilant, and all will yet go well.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Worthy Bertuccio, I have known you ever </l>
				<l>Trusty and brave, with head and heart to plan </l>
				<l>What I have still been prompt to execute. </l>
				<l>For my own part, I seek no other Chief; </l>
				<l>What the rest will decide, I know not, but </l>

				<l>Battling at Zara, did the hecatombs </l>
				<l>Of thine and Venice' foes, there offered up </l>
				<l>By thy descendant, merit such acquittance? </l>
				<l>Spirits! smile down upon me! for my cause </l>
				<l>Is yours, in all life now can be of yours,--- </l>

				<l>And in the future fortunes of our race! </l>

					Ber.</speaker><l>Who goes there?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> A friend to Venice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> 'Tis he. </l>
				<l>Welcome, my Lord,---you are before the time.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I am ready to proceed to your assembly.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Have with you.---I am proud and pleased to see </l>
				<l>Such confident alacrity. Your doubts </l>
				<l>Since our last meeting, then, are all dispelled?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Not so---but I have set my little left </l>
				<l>Of life upon this cast: the die was thrown </l>
				<l>When I first listened to your treason.---Start not! </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>That</speaker><l> is the word; I cannot shape my tongueTo syllable
					black deeds into smooth names, </l>
				<l>Though I be wrought on to commit them. When </l>
				<l>I heard you tempt your Sovereign, and forbore </l>
				<l>To have you dragged to prison, I became </l>
				<l>Your guiltiest accomplice: now you may, </l>
				<l>If it so please you, do as much by me.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Strange words, my Lord, and most unmerited; </l>
				<l>I am no spy, and neither are we traitors.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>We---We!</l>
				<l>---no matter---you have earned the right</l>
				<l>To talk of <em>us</em></l>
				<l>.---But to the point.---If this</l>
				<l>Attempt succeeds, and Venice, rendered free </l>
				<l>And flourishing, when we are in our graves, </l>
				<l>Conducts her generations to our tombs, </l>
				<l>And makes her children with their little hands </l>
				<l>Strew flowers o'er her deliverers' ashes, then </l>
				<l> The consequence will sanctify the deed, </l>
				<l>And we shall be like the two Bruti in </l>
				<l>The annals of hereafter; but if not, </l>
				<l>If we should fail, employing bloody means </l>
				<l>And secret plot, although to a good end, </l>
				<l>Still we are traitors, honest Israel;---thou </l>
				<l>No less than he who was thy Sovereign </l>
				<l>Six hours ago, and now thy brother rebel.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>'Tis not the moment to consider thus, </l>
				<l>Else I could answer.---Let us to the meeting, </l>
				<l>Or we may be observed in lingering here.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> We</l>
				<em>are</em>
				<l>observed, and have been.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> We observed! </l>
				<l>Let me discover---and this steel---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Put up; </l>
				<l>Here are no human witnesses: look there--- </l>
				<l>What see you?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Only a tall warrior's statue </l>
				<l>Bestriding a proud steed, in the dim light </l>
				<l>Of the dull moon.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> That Warrior was the sire </l>
				<l>Of my sire's fathers, and that statue was </l>
				<l>Decreed to him by the twice rescued city:--- </l>
				<l>Think you that he looks down on us or no?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>My Lord, these are mere fantasies; there are </l>
				<l> No eyes in marble.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> But there are in Death. </l>
				<l>I tell thee, man, there is a spirit in </l>
				<l>Such things that acts and sees, unseen, though felt; </l>
				<l>And, if there be a spell to stir the dead, </l>
				<l>'Tis in such deeds as we are now upon. </l>
				<l>Deem'st thou the souls of such a race as mine </l>
				<l>Can rest, when he, their last descendant Chief, </l>
				<l>Stands plotting on the brink of their pure graves </l>
				<l>With stung plebeians?</l> </sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> It had been as
					well </l>
				<l>To have pondered this before,---ere you embarked </l>
				<l>In our great enterprise.---Do you repent?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> No---but I</l>
				<em>feel</em>
				<l>, and shall do to the last.I cannot quench a glorious life at once, </l>
				<l>Nor dwindle to the thing I now must be, </l>
				<l>And take men's lives by stealth, without some pause: </l>
				<l>Yet doubt me not; it is this very feeling, </l>
				<l>And knowing</l>
				<em>what</em>
				<l>has wrung me to be thus,Which is your best security. There's not </l>
				<l>A roused mechanic in your busy plot </l>
				<l>So wronged as I, so fall'n, so loudly called </l>
				<l>To his redress: the very means I am forced </l>
				<l>By these fell tyrants to adopt is such, </l>
				<l>That I abhor them doubly for the deeds </l>
				<l> Which I must do to pay them back for theirs.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Let us away---hark---the Hour strikes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> On---on--- </l>
				<l>It is our knell, or that of Venice.---On.</l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Have you not been able to complete </l>
				<l>The number wanting in your company?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>I had marked out some: but I have not dared </l>
				<l>To trust them with the secret, till assured </l>
				<l>That they were worthy faith.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> There is no need </l>
				<l>Of trusting to their faith;</l>
				<em>who</em>
				<l>, save ourselvesAnd our more chosen comrades, is aware </l>
				<l>Fully of our intent? they think themselves </l>
				<l>Engaged in secret to the Signory,To punish some more dissolute young nobles </l>
				<l>Who have defied the law in their excesses; </l>
				<l>But once drawn up, and their new swords well fleshed </l>
				<l>In the rank hearts of the more odious Senators, </l>
				<l>They will not hesitate to follow up </l>
				<l>Their blow upon the others, when they see </l>
				<l>The example of their chiefs, and I for one </l>
				<l>Will set them such, that they for very shame </l>
				<l> And safety will not pause till all have perished.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> How say you?</l>
				<em>all!</em>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Whom wouldst thou spare?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>I spare?</l>
				<l>I have no power to spare. I only questioned, </l>
				<l>Thinking that even amongst these wicked men </l>
				<l>There might be some, whose age and qualities </l>
				<l>Might mark them out for pity.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Yes, such pity </l>
				<l>As when the viper hath been cut to pieces, </l>
				<l>The separate fragments quivering in the sun, </l>
				<l>In the last energy of venomous life, </l>
				<l>Deserve and have. Why, I should think as soon </l>
				<l>Of pitying some particular fang which made </l>
				<l>One in the jaw of the swoln serpent, as </l>
				<l>Of saving one of these: they form but links </l>
				<l>Of one long chain; one mass, one breath, one body; </l>
				<l>They eat, and drink, and live, and breed together, </l>
				<l>Revel, and lie, oppress, and kill in concert,--- </l>
				<l>So let them die as</l>
				<em>one!</em>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Dag.</speaker><l> Should</l>
				<em>one</em>
				<l>survive,He would be dangerous as the whole; it is not </l>
				<l>Their number, be it tens or thousands, but </l>
				<l>The spirit of this Aristocracy </l>
				<l>Which must be rooted out; and if there were </l>
				<l> A single shoot of the old tree in life, </l>
				<l>'Twould fasten in the soil, and spring again </l>
				<l>To gloomy verdure and to bitter fruit. </l>
				<l>Bertram, we must be firm!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Look to it well </l>
				<l>Bertram! I have an eye upon thee.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Who </l>
				<l>Distrusts me?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Not I; for if I did so, </l>
				<l>Thou wouldst not now be there to talk of trust: </l>
				<l>It is thy softness, not thy want of faith, </l>
				<l>Which makes thee to be doubted.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> You should know </l>
				<l>Who hear me, who and what I am; a man </l>
				<l>Roused like yourselves to overthrow oppression; </l>
				<l>A kind man, I am apt to think, as some </l>
				<l>Of you have found me; and if brave or no, </l>
				<l>You, Calendaro, can pronounce, who have seen me </l>
				<l>Put to the proof; or, if you should have doubts, </l>
				<l>I'll clear them on your person!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> You are welcome, </l>
				<l>When once our enterprise is o'er, which must not </l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>I am no brawler; but can bear myself </l>
				<l>As far among the foe as any he </l>
				<l> Who hears me; else why have I been selected </l>
				<l>To be of your chief comrades? but no less </l>
				<l>I own my natural weakness; I have not </l>
				<l>Yet learned to think of indiscriminate murder </l>
				<l>Without some sense of shuddering; and the sight </l>
				<l>Of blood which spouts through hoary scalps is not </l>
				<l>To me a thing of triumph, nor the death </l>
				<l>Of man surprised a glory. Well---too well </l>
				<l>I know that we must do such things on those </l>
				<l>Whose acts have raised up such avengers; but </l>
				<l>If there were some of these who could be saved </l>
				<l>From out this sweeping fate, for our own sakes </l>
				<l>And for our honour, to take off some stain </l>
				<l>Of massacre, which else pollutes it wholly, </l>
				<l>I had been glad; and see no cause in this </l>
				<l>For sneer, nor for suspicion!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Dag.</speaker><l> Calm thee, Bertram, </l>
				<l>For we suspect thee not, and take good heart. </l>

				<l>Who is this stranger?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> It is time to name him. </l>
				<l> Our comrades are even now prepared to greet him </l>
				<l>In brotherhood, as I have made it known </l>
				<l>That thou wouldst add a brother to our cause, </l>
				<l>Approved by thee, and thus approved by all, </l>
				<l>Such is our trust in all thine actions. Now </l>
				<l>Let him unfold himself.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Stranger, step forth! <stage>The Doge discovers
						himself.</stage></l> </sp><sp><speaker>Consp.</speaker>To arms!---we are
				betrayed---it is the Doge! <l>Down with them both! our traitorous captain, and </l>
				<l>The tyrant he hath sold us to.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>Cal.</l>
					<l>(drawing his sword).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> Hold! hold! </l>
				<l>Who moves a step against them dies. Hold! hear </l>
				<l>Bertuccio---What! are you appalled to see </l>
				<l>A lone, unguarded, weaponless old man </l>
				<l>Amongst you?---Israel, speak! what means this mystery?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Let them advance and strike at their own bosoms, </l>
				<l>Ungrateful suicides! for on our lives </l>
				<l>Depend their own, their fortunes, and their hopes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Strike!---If I dreaded death, a death more fearful </l>
				<l>Than any your rash weapons can inflict, </l>
				<l>I should not now be here: Oh, noble Courage! </l>
				<l>The eldest born of Fear, which makes you brave </l>
				<l>Against this solitary hoary head! </l>
				<l>See the bold chiefs, who would reform a state </l>
				<l>And shake down senates, mad with wrath and dread </l>
				<l> At sight of one patrician! Butcher me! </l>
				<l>You can, I care not.---Israel, are these men </l>
				<l>The mighty hearts you spoke of? look upon them!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Faith! he hath shamed us, and deservedly. </l>
				<l>Was this your trust in your true Chief Bertuccio, </l>
				<l>To turn your swords against him and his guest? </l>
				<l>Sheathe them, and hear him.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> I disdain to speak. </l>
				<l>They might and must have known a heart like mine </l>
				<l>Incapable of treachery; and the power </l>
				<l>They gave me to adopt all fitting means </l>
				<l>To further their design was ne'er abused. </l>
				<l>They might be certain that who e'er was brought </l>
				<l>By me into this Council had been led </l>
				<l>To take his choice---as brother, or as victim.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>And which am I to be? your actions leave </l>
				<l>Some cause to doubt the freedom of the choice.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>My Lord, we would have perished here together, </l>
				<l>Had these rash men proceeded; but, behold, </l>
				<l>They are ashamed of that mad moment's impulse, </l>
				<l>And droop their heads; believe me, they are such </l>
				<l>As I described them.---Speak to them.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> Aye, speak; </l>
				<l>We are all listening in wonder.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>
					<l>I. Ber.</l>
					<l>(addressing the conspirators).</l>
				</speaker><l> </l>
				<l> You are safe, </l>
				<l> Nay, more, almost triumphant---listen then, </l>
				<l>And know my words for truth.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> You see me here, </l>
				<l>As one of you hath said, an old, unarmed, </l>
				<l>Defenceless man; and yesterday you saw me </l>
				<l>Presiding in the hall of ducal state, </l>
				<l>Apparent Sovereign of our hundred isles, </l>
				<l>Robed in official purple, dealing out </l>
				<l>The edicts of a power which is not mine, </l>
				<l>Nor yours, but of our masters---the patricians. </l>
				<l>Why I was there you know, or think you know; </l>
				<l>Why I am</l>
				<em>here</em>
				<l>, he who hath been most wronged,He who among you hath been most insulted, </l>
				<l>Outraged and trodden on, until he doubt </l>
				<l>If he be worm or no, may answer for me, </l>
				<l>Asking of his own heart what brought him here? </l>
				<l>You know my recent story, all men know it, </l>
				<l>And judge of it far differently from those </l>
				<l>Who sate in judgement to heap scorn on scorn. </l>
				<l>But spare me the recital---it is here, </l>
				<l>Here at my heart the outrage---but my words, </l>
				<l>Already spent in unavailing plaints, </l>
				<l>Would only show my feebleness the more, </l>
				<l>And I come here to strengthen even the strong, </l>
				<l>And urge them on to deeds, and not to war </l>
				<l> With woman's weapons; but I need not urge you. </l>
				<l>Our private wrongs have sprung from public vices, </l>
				<l>In this---I cannot call it commonwealth, </l>
				<l>Nor kingdom, which hath neither prince nor people, </l>
				<l>But all the sins of the old Spartan state </l>
				<l>Without its virtues---temperance and valour. </l>
				<l>The Lords of Lacedaemon were true soldiers, </l>
				<l>But ours are Sybarites, while we are Helots, </l>
				<l>Of whom I am the lowest, most enslaved; </l>
				<l>Although dressed out to head a pageant, as </l>
				<l>The Greeks of yore made drunk their slaves to form </l>
				<l>A pastime for their children. You are met </l>
				<l>To overthrow this Monster of a state, </l>
				<l>This mockery of a Government, this spectre, </l>
				<l>Which must be exorcised with blood,---and then </l>
				<l>We will renew the times of Truth and Justice, </l>
				<l>Condensing in a fair free commonwealth </l>
				<l>Not rash equality but equal rights, </l>
				<l>Proportioned like the columns to the temple, </l>
				<l>Giving and taking strength reciprocal, </l>
				<l>And making firm the whole with grace and beauty, </l>
				<l>So that no part could be removed without </l>
				<l>Infringement of the general symmetry. </l>
				<l>In operating this great change, I claim </l>
				<l>To be one of you---if you trust in me; </l>
				<l> If not, strike home,---my life is compromised, </l>
				<l>And I would rather fall by freemen's hands </l>
				<l>Than live another day to act the tyrant </l>
				<l>As delegate of tyrants: such I am not, </l>
				<l>And never have been---read it in our annals; </l>
				<l>I can appeal to my past government </l>
				<l>In many lands and cities; they can tell you </l>
				<l>If I were an oppressor, or a man </l>
				<l>Feeling and thinking for my fellow men. </l>
				<l>Haply had I been what the Senate sought, </l>
				<l>A thing of robes and trinkets, dizened out </l>
				<l>To sit in state as for a Sovereign's picture; </l>
				<l>A popular scourge, a ready sentence-signer, </l>
				<l>A stickler for the Senate and "the Forty," </l>
				<l>A sceptic of all measures which had not </l>
				<l>The sanction of "the Ten," a council-fawner, </l>
				<l>A tool---a fool---a puppet,---they had ne'er </l>
				<l>Fostered the wretch who stung me. What I suffer </l>
				<l>Has reached me through my pity for the people; </l>
				<l>That many know, and they who know not yet </l>
				<l>Will one day learn: meantime I do devote, </l>
				<l>Whate'er the issue, my last days of life--- </l>
				<l>My present power such as it is, not that </l>
				<l>Of Doge, but of a man who has been great </l>
				<l>Before he was degraded to a Doge, </l>
				<l> And still has individual means and mind; </l>
				<l>I stake my fame (and I had fame)---my breath--- </l>
				<l>(The least of all, for its last hours are nigh) </l>
				<l>My heart---my hope---my soul---upon this cast! </l>
				<l>Such as I am, I offer me to you </l>
				<l>And to your chiefs; accept me or reject me,--- </l>
				<l>A Prince who fain would be a Citizen </l>
				<l>Or nothing, and who has left his throne to be so.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Long live Faliero!---Venice shall be free!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Consp.</speaker><l>Long live Faliero!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Comrades! did I well? </l>
				<l>Is not this man a host in such a cause?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>This is no time for eulogies, nor place </l>
				<l>For exultation. Am I one of you?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Aye, and the first among us, as thou hast been </l>
				<l>Of Venice---be our General and Chief.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Chief!---General!---I was General at Zara, </l>
				<l>And Chief in Rhodes and Cyprus, Prince in Venice: </l>
				<l>I cannot stoop --- that is, I am not fit </l>
				<l>To lead a band of --- patriots: when I lay </l>
				<l>Aside the dignities which I have borne, </l>
				<l>'Tis not to put on others, but to be </l>
				<l>Mate to my fellows---but now to the point: </l>
				<l>Israel has stated to me your whole plan--- </l>
				<l>'Tis bold, but feasible if I assist it, </l>
				<l> And must be set in motion instantly.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>E'en when thou wilt. Is it not so, my friends? </l>
				<l>I have disposed all for a sudden blow; </l>
				<l>When shall it be then?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> At sunrise.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> So soon?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>So soon?---so late---each hour accumulates </l>
				<l>Peril on peril, and the more so now </l>
				<l>Since I have mingled with you;---know you not </l>
				<l>The Council, and "the Ten?" the spies, the eyes </l>
				<l>Of the patricians dubious of their slaves, </l>
				<l>And now more dubious of the Prince they have made one? </l>
				<l>I tell you, you must strike, and suddenly, </l>
				<l>Full to the Hydra's heart---its heads will follow.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>With all my soul and sword, I yield assent; </l>
				<l>Our companies are ready, sixty each, </l>
				<l>And all now under arms by Israel's order; </l>
				<l>Each at their different place of rendezvous, </l>
				<l>And vigilant, expectant of some blow; </l>
				<l>Let each repair for action to his post! </l>
				<l>And now, my Lord, the signal?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> When you hear </l>
				<l>The great bell of Saint Mark's, which may not be </l>
				<l>Struck without special order of the Doge </l>
				<l>(The last poor privilege they leave their Prince), </l>
				<l> March on Saint Mark's!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> And there?---</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> By different routes </l>
				<l>Let your march be directed, every sixty </l>
				<l>Entering a separate avenue, and still </l>
				<l>Upon the way let your cry be of War </l>
				<l>And of the Genoese Fleet, by the first dawn </l>
				<l>Discerned before the port; form round the palace, </l>
				<l>Within whose court will be drawn out in arms </l>
				<l>My nephew and the clients of our house, </l>
				<l>Many and martial; while the bell tolls on, </l>
				<l>Shout ye, "Saint Mark!---the foe is on our waters!"</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>I see it now---but on, my noble Lord.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>All the patricians flocking to the Council, </l>
				<l>(Which they dare not refuse, at the dread signal </l>
				<l>Pealing from out their Patron Saint's proud tower,) </l>
				<l>Will then be gathered in unto the harvest, </l>
				<l>And we will reap them with the sword for sickle. </l>

			</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Once more, sir, with your pardon, I </l>
				<l>Would now repeat the question which I asked </l>
				<l> Before Bertuccio added to our cause </l>
				<l>This great ally who renders it more sure, </l>
				<l>And therefore safer, and as such admits </l>
				<l>Some dawn of mercy to a portion of </l>
				<l>Our victims---must all perish in this slaughter?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>All who encounter me and mine---be sure, </l>
				<l>The mercy they have shown, I show.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Consp.</speaker><l> All! all! </l>
				<l>Is this a time to talk of pity? when </l>
				<l>Have they e'er shown, or felt, or feigned it?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> Bertram, </l>
				<l>This false compassion is a folly, and </l>
				<l>Injustice to thy comrades and thy cause! </l>
				<l>Dost thou not see, that if we single out </l>
				<l>Some for escape, they live but to avenge </l>
				<l>The fallen? and how distinguish now the innocent </l>
				<l>From out the guilty? all their acts are one--- </l>
				<l>A single emanation from one body, </l>
				<l>Together knit for our oppression! 'Tis </l>
				<l>Much that we let their children live; I doubt </l>
				<l>If all of these even should be set apart: </l>
				<l>The hunter may reserve some single cub </l>
				<l>From out the tiger's litter, but who e'er </l>
				<l>Would seek to save the spotted sire or dam, </l>
				<l>Unless to perish by their fangs? however, </l>
				<l> I will abide by Doge Faliero's counsel: </l>
				<l>Let him decide if any should be saved.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Ask me not---tempt me not with such a question--- </l>
				<l>Decide yourselves.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l> You know their private virtues </l>
				<l>Far better than we can, to whom alone </l>
				<l>Their public vices, and most foul oppression, </l>
				<l>Have made them deadly; if there be amongst them </l>
				<l>One who deserves to be repealed, pronounce.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Dolfino's father was my friend, and Lando </l>
				<l>Fought by my side, and Marc Cornaro shared </l>
				<l>My Genoese embassy: I saved the life </l>
				<l>Of Veniero---shall I save it twice? </l>
				<l>Would that I could save them and Venice also! </l>
				<l>All these men, or their fathers, were my friends </l>
				<l>Till they became my subjects; then fell from me </l>
				<l>As faithless leaves drop from the o'erblown flower, </l>
				<l>And left me a lone blighted thorny stalk, </l>
				<l>Which, in its solitude, can shelter nothing; </l>
				<l>So, as they let me wither, let them perish!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>They cannot co-exist with Venice' freedom!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Ye, though you know and feel our mutual mass </l>
				<l>Of many wrongs, even ye are ignorant </l>
				<l>What fatal poison to the springs of Life, </l>
				<l>To human ties, and all that's good and dear, </l>
				<l> Lurks in the present institutes of Venice: </l>
				<l>All these men were my friends; I loved them, they </l>
				<l>Requited honourably my regards; </l>
				<l>We served and fought; we smiled and wept in concert; </l>
				<l>We revelled or we sorrowed side by side; </l>
				<l>We made alliances of blood and marriage; </l>
				<l>We grew in years and honours fairly,---till </l>
				<l>Their own desire, not my ambition, made </l>
				<l>Them choose me for their Prince, and then farewell! </l>
				<l>Farewell all social memory! all thoughts </l>
				<l>In common! and sweet bonds which link old friendships, </l>
				<l>When the survivors of long years and actions, </l>
				<l>Which now belong to history, soothe the days </l>
				<l>Which yet remain by treasuring each other, </l>
				<l>And never meet, but each beholds the mirror </l>
				<l>Of half a century on his brother's brow, </l>
				<l>And sees a hundred beings, now in earth, </l>
				<l>Flit round them whispering of the days gone by, </l>
				<l>And seeming not all dead, as long as two </l>
				<l>Of the brave, joyous, reckless, glorious band, </l>
				<l>Which once were one and many, still retain </l>
				<l>A breath to sigh for them, a tongue to speak </l>
				<l>Of deeds that else were silent, save on marble--- </l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Oim√©! Oim√©!</speaker><l> ---and must I do this deed?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>My Lord, you are much moved: it is not now </l>
				<l> That such things must be dwelt upon.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Your patience </l>
				<l>A moment---I recede not: mark with me </l>
				<l>The gloomy vices of this government. </l>
				<l>From the hour they made me Doge, the</l>
				<em>Doge</em>
				<strong>they</strong>
				<em>made</em>
				<l>me---Farewell the past! I died to all that had been, </l>
				<l>Or rather they to me: no friends, no kindness, </l>
				<l>No privacy of life---all were cut off: </l>
				<l>They came not near me---such approach gave umbrage; </l>
				<l>They could not love me---such was not the law; </l>
				<l>They thwarted me---'twas the state's policy; </l>
				<l>They baffled me---'twas a patrician's duty; </l>
				<l>They wronged me, for such was to right the state; </l>
				<l>They could not right me---that would give suspicion; </l>
				<l>So that I was a slave to my own subjects; </l>
				<l>So that I was a foe to my own friends; </l>
				<l>Begirt with spies for guards, with robes for power, </l>
				<l>With pomp for freedom, gaolers for a council, </l>
				<l>Inquisitors for friends, and Hell for life! </l>
				<l>I had only one fount of quiet left, </l>
				<l>And</l>
				<em>that</em>
				<l>they poisoned! My pure household godsWere shivered on my hearth, and o'er their
					shrine </l>
				<l>Sate grinning Ribaldry, and sneering Scorn.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>You have been deeply wronged, and now shall be </l>
				<l>Nobly avenged before another night.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I had borne all---it hurt me, but I bore it--- </l>
				<l>Till this last running over of the cup </l>
				<l>Of bitterness---until this last loud insult, </l>
				<l>Not only unredressed, but sanctioned; then, </l>
				<l>And thus, I cast all further feelings from me--- </l>
				<l>The feelings which they crushed for me, long, long </l>
				<l>Before, even in their oath of false allegiance! </l>
				<l>Even in that very hour and vow, they abjured </l>
				<l>Their friend and made a Sovereign, as boys make </l>
				<l>Playthings, to do their pleasure---and be broken! </l>
				<l>I from that hour have seen but Senators </l>
				<l>In dark suspicious conflict with the Doge, </l>
				<l>Brooding with him in mutual hate and fear; </l>
				<l>They dreading he should snatch the tyranny </l>
				<l>From out their grasp, and he abhorring tyrants. </l>
				<l>To me, then, these men have no</l>
				<em>private</em>
				<l>life,Nor claim to ties they have cut off from others; </l>
				<l>As Senators for arbitrary acts </l>
				<l>Amenable, I look on them---as such </l>
				<l>Let them be dealt upon.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l> And now to action! </l>
				<l>Hence, brethren, to our posts, and may this be </l>
				<l>The last night of mere words: I'd fain be doing! </l>
				<l>Saint Mark's great bell at dawn shall find me wakeful!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Disperse then to your posts: be firm and vigilant; </l>
				<l> Think on the wrongs we bear, the rights we claim. </l>
				<l>This day and night shall be the last of peril! </l>
				<l>Watch for the signal, and then march. I go </l>
				<l>To join my band; let each be prompt to marshal </l>
				<l>His separate charge: the Doge will now return </l>
				<l>To the palace to prepare all for the blow. </l>
				<l>We part to meet in Freedom and in Glory!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Doge, when I greet you next, my homage to you </l>
				<l>Shall be the head of Steno on this sword!</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>No; let him be reserved unto the last, </l>
				<l>Nor turn aside to strike at such a prey, </l>
				<l>Till nobler game is quarried: his offence </l>
				<l>Was a mere ebullition of the vice, </l>
				<l>The general corruption generated </l>
				<l>By the foul Aristocracy: he could not--- </l>
				<l>He dared not in more honourable days </l>
				<l>Have risked it. I have merged all private wrath </l>
				<l>Against him in the thought of our great purpose. </l>
				<l>A slave insults me---I require his punishment </l>
				<l>From his proud master's hands; if he refuse it, </l>
				<l>The offence grows his, and let him answer it.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Yet, as the immediate cause of the alliance </l>
				<l>Which consecrates our undertaking more, </l>
				<l>I owe him such deep gratitude, that fain </l>
				<l>I would repay him as he merits; may I?</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> You would but lop the hand, and I the head; </l>
				<l>You would but smite the scholar, I the master; </l>
				<l>You would but punish Steno, I the Senate. </l>
				<l>I cannot pause on individual hate, </l>
				<l>In the absorbing, sweeping, whole revenge, </l>
				<l>Which, like the sheeted fire from Heaven, must blast </l>
				<l>Without distinction, as it fell of yore, </l>
				<l>Where the Dead Sea hath quenched two Cities' ashes.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>I. Ber.</speaker><l>Away, then, to your posts! I but remain </l>
				<l>A moment to accompany the Doge </l>
				<l>To our late place of tryst, to see no spies </l>
				<l>Have been upon the scout, and thence I hasten </l>
				<l>To where my allotted band is under arms.</l>
			</sp><sp><speaker>Cal.</speaker><l>Farewell, then,---until dawn!</l>

				<em>you</em>
				<l>ne'er spake with them;You never broke their bread, nor shared their salt; </l>
				<l>You never had their wine-cup at your lips: </l>

				<l>Nor held a revel in their company; </l>
				<l>Ne'er smiled to see them smile, nor claimed their smile </l>
				<l> In social interchange for yours, nor trusted </l>
				<l>Nor wore them in your heart of hearts, as I have: </l>
				<l>These hairs of mine are grey, and so are theirs, </l>
				<l>The elders of the Council: I remember </l>
				<l>When all our locks were like the raven's wing, </l>
				<l>As we went forth to take our prey around </l>

				<l>From high resolves into such shallow weakness! </l>
				<l>You have seen blood in battle, shed it, both </l>

				<l>Ah! no; it is the</l>

				<l>But let these last and lingering thoughts have way, </l>
				<l> To which you only and the night are conscious, </l>
				<l>And both regardless; when the Hour arrives, </l>
				<l>'Tis mine to sound the knell, and strike the blow, </l>
				<l>Which shall unpeople many palaces, </l>

				<l>You</l>

				<em>you</em>
				<l>go to this butcher-workAs if these high-born men were steers for shambles: </l>

				<l>But I, outgoing thee and all thy fellows </l>
				<l>In this surpassing massacre, shall be, </l>

				<l> "My own free will and act," and yet you err, </l>

					<l> Though my breast feels too anxious; I will try </l>
					<l>Whether the air will calm my spirits: 'tis </l>
					<l>A goodly night; the cloudy wind which blew </l>
					<l>From the Levant hath crept into its cave, </l>
					<l>And the broad Moon hath brightened. What a stillness! </l>
					<stage>Goes to an open lattice.</stage> And what a contrast with the scene I
					left, <l>Where the tall torches' glare, and silver lamps' </l>
					<l>More pallid gleam along the tapestried walls, </l>
					<l>Spread over the reluctant gloom which haunts </l>
					<l>Those vast and dimly-latticed galleries </l>
					<l>A dazzling mass of artificial light, </l>
					<l>Which showed all things, but nothing as they were. </l>
					<l>There Age essaying to recall the past, </l>
					<l>After long striving for the hues of Youth </l>
					<l>At the sad labour of the toilet, and </l>
					<l>Full many a glance at the too faithful mirror, </l>
					<l>Pranked forth in all the pride of ornament, </l>
					<l>Forgot itself, and trusting to the falsehood </l>
					<l>Of the indulgent beams, which show, yet hide, </l>
					<l>Believed itself forgotten, and was fooled. </l>
					<l>There Youth, which needed not, nor thought of such </l>
					<l>Vain adjuncts, lavished its true bloom, and health, </l>
					<l>And bridal beauty, in the unwholesome press </l>
					<l>Of flushed and crowded wassailers, and wasted </l>
					<l>Its hours of rest in dreaming this was pleasure, </l>
					<l> And so shall waste them till the sunrise streams </l>
					<l>On sallow cheeks and sunken eyes, which should not </l>
					<l>Have worn this aspect yet for many a year. </l>
					<l>The music, and the banquet, and the wine, </l>
					<l>The garlands, the rose odours, and the flowers, </l>
					<l>The sparkling eyes, and flashing ornaments, </l>
					<l>The white arms and the raven hair, the braids </l>
					<l>And bracelets; swanlike bosoms, and the necklace, </l>
					<l>An India in itself, yet dazzling not </l>
					<l>The eye like what it circled; the thin robes, </l>
					<l>Floating like light clouds 'twixt our gaze and heaven; </l>
					<l>The many-twinkling feet so small and sylphlike, </l>
					<l>Suggesting the more secret symmetry </l>
					<l>Of the fair forms which terminate so well--- </l>
					<l>All the delusion of the dizzy scene, </l>
					<l>Its false and true enchantments---Art and Nature, </l>
					<l>Which swam before my giddy eyes, that drank </l>
					<l>The sight of beauty as the parched pilgrim's </l>
					<l>On Arab sands the false mirage, which offers </l>
					<l>A lucid lake to his eluded thirst, </l>
					<l>Are gone. Around me are the stars and waters--- </l>

					<l>And the great Element, which is to space </l>
					<l>What Ocean is to Earth, spreads its blue depths, </l>
					<l> Softened with the first breathings of the spring; </l>
					<l>The high Moon sails upon her beauteous way, </l>
					<l>Serenely smoothing o'er the lofty walls </l>
					<l>Of those tall piles and sea-girt palaces, </l>
					<l>Whose porphyry pillars, and whose costly fronts, </l>
					<l>Fraught with the Orient spoil of many marbles, </l>
					<l>Like altars ranged along the broad canal, </l>
					<l>Seem each a trophy of some mighty deed </l>
					<l>Reared up from out the waters, scarce less strangely </l>
					<l>Than those more massy and mysterious giants </l>
					<l>Of architecture, those Titanian fabrics, </l>
					<l>Which point in Egypt's plains to times that have </l>
					<l>No other record. All is gentle: nought </l>
					<l>Stirs rudely; but, congenial with the night, </l>
					<l>Whatever walks is gliding like a spirit. </l>
					<l>The tinklings of some vigilant guitars </l>
					<l>Of sleepless lovers to a wakeful mistress, </l>
					<l>And cautious opening of the casement, showing </l>
					<l>That he is not unheard; while her young hand, </l>
					<l>Fair as the moonlight of which it seems part, </l>
					<l>So delicately white, it trembles in </l>
					<l>The act of opening the forbidden lattice, </l>
					<l>To let in love through music, makes his heart </l>
					<l>Thrill like his lyre-strings at the sight; the dash </l>
					<l>Phosphoric of the oar, or rapid twinkle </l>
					<l> Of the far lights of skimming gondolas, </l>
					<l>And the responsive voices of the choir </l>
					<l>Of boatmen answering back with verse for verse; </l>
					<l>Some dusky shadow checkering the Rialto; </l>
					<l>Some glimmering palace roof, or tapering spire, </l>
					<l>Are all the sights and sounds which here pervade </l>
					<l>The ocean-born and earth-commanding City--- </l>
					<l>How sweet and soothing is this hour of calm! </l>
					<l>I thank thee, Night! for thou hast chased away </l>
					<l>Those horrid bodements which, amidst the throng, </l>
					<l>I could not dissipate: and with the blessing </l>
					<l>Of thy benign and quiet influence, </l>
					<l>Now will I to my couch, although to rest </l>
					<l>Is almost wronging such a night as this.--- </l>
					<stage>A knocking is heard from without.</stage>
					<l>Hark! what is that? or who at such a moment?</l>
					<stage>Enter <strong>Antonio</strong> . </stage>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l>My Lord, a man without, on urgent business, </l>
					<l>Implores to be admitted.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> Is he a stranger?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l>His face is muffled in his cloak, but both </l>
					<l>His voice and gestures seem familiar to me; </l>
					<l>I craved his name, but this he seemed reluctant </l>
					<l>To trust, save to yourself; most earnestly </l>
					<l>He sues to be permitted to approach you.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>'Tis a strange hour, and a suspicious bearing! </l>
					<l>And yet there is slight peril: 'tis not in </l>
					<l> Their houses noble men are struck at; still, </l>
					<l>Although I know not that I have a foe </l>
					<l>In Venice, 'twill be wise to use some caution. </l>
					<l>Admit him, and retire; but call up quickly </l>
					<l>Some of thy fellows, who may wait without.--- </l> Who can this man be?--- <em>
						<l>[Exit</l>
						<strong>Antonio</strong>
						<l>, and returns with</l>
						<strong>Bertram</strong>
						<l>muffled.</l>
					</em>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> My good Lord Lioni, </l>
					<l>I have no time to lose, nor thou,---dismiss </l>
					<l>This menial hence; I would be private with you.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>It seems the voice of Bertram---Go, Antonio. </l>
					<em>
						<l>[Exit</l>
						<strong>Antonio</strong>
						<l>.</l>
					</em>
					<l>Now, stranger, what would you at such an hour?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>
						<l>Ber.</l>
						<l>(discovering himself).</l>
					</speaker><l> A boon, my noble patron; you have granted </l>
					<l>Many to your poor client, Bertram; add </l>
					<l>This one, and make him happy.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> Thou hast known me </l>
					<l>From boyhood, ever ready to assist thee </l>
					<l>In all fair objects of advancement, which </l>
					<l>Beseem one of thy station; I would promise </l>
					<l>Ere thy request was heard, but that the hour, </l>
					<l>Thy bearing, and this strange and hurried mode </l>
					<l>Of suing, gives me to suspect this visit </l>
					<l>Hath some mysterious import---but say on--- </l>
					<l>What has occurred, some rash and sudden broil?--- </l>
					<l>A cup too much, a scuffle, and a stab? </l>
					<l>Mere things of every day; so that thou hast not </l>
					<l> Spilt noble blood, I guarantee thy safety; </l>
					<l>But then thou must withdraw, for angry friends </l>
					<l>And relatives, in the first burst of vengeance, </l>
					<l>Are things in Venice deadlier than the laws.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>My Lord, I thank you; but---</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> But what? You have not </l>
					<l>Raised a rash hand against one of our order? </l>
					<l>If so---withdraw and fly---and own it not; </l>
					<l>I would not slay---but then I must not save thee! </l>
					<l>He who has shed patrician blood---</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> I come </l>
					<l>To save patrician blood, and not to shed it! </l>
					<l>And thereunto I must be speedy, for </l>
					<l>Each minute lost may lose a life; since Time </l>
					<l>Has changed his slow scythe for the two-edged sword, </l>
					<l>And is about to take, instead of sand, </l>
					<l>The dust from sepulchres to fill; his hour-glass!--- </l>
					<l>Go not</l>
					<em>thou</em>
					<l>forth to-morrow!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> Wherefore not?--- </l>
					<l>What means this menace?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Do not seek its meaning, </l>
					<l>But do as I implore thee;---stir not forth, </l>
					<l>Whate'er be stirring; though the roar of crowds--- </l>
					<l>The cry of women, and the shrieks of babes--- </l>
					<l>The groans of men---the clash of arms---the sound </l>
					<l> Of rolling drum, shrill trump, and hollow bell, </l>
					<l>Peal in one wide alarum l---Go not forth, </l>
					<l>Until the Tocsin's silent, nor even then </l>
					<l>Till I return!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> Again, what does this mean?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Again, I tell thee, ask not; but by all </l>
					<l>Thou holdest dear on earth or Heaven---by all </l>
					<l>The Souls of thy great fathers, and thy hope </l>
					<l>To emulate them, and to leave behind </l>
					<l>Descendants worthy both of them and thee--- </l>
					<l>By all thou hast of blessed in hope or memory--- </l>
					<l>By all thou hast to fear here or hereafter--- </l>
					<l>By all the good deeds thou hast done to me, </l>
					<l>Good I would now repay with greater good, </l>
					<l>Remain within---trust to thy household gods, </l>
					<l>And to my word for safety, if thou dost, </l>
					<l>As I now counsel---but if not, thou art lost!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>I am indeed already lost in wonder; </l>
					<l>Surely thou ravest! what have</l>
					<em>I</em>
					<l>to dread?</l>
					<l>Who are my foes? or if there be such,</l>
					<em>why</em>
					<l>Art</l>
					<em>thou</em>
					<l>leagued with them?---</l>
					<em>thou!</em>
					<l>or, if so leagued,Why comest thou to tell me at this hour, </l>
					<l>And not before?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> I cannot answer this. </l>
					<l>Wilt thou go forth despite of this true warning?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> I was not born to shrink from idle threats, </l>
					<l>The cause of which I know not: at the hour </l>
					<l>Of council, be it soon or late, I shall not </l>
					<l>Be found among the absent.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Say not so! </l>
					<l>Once more, art thou determined to go forth?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>I am. Nor is there aught which shall impede
						me!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Then, Heaven have mercy on thy soul!---Farewell!
							<stage>Going.</stage></l> </sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker>Stay---there
					is more in this than my own safety <l>Which makes me call thee back; we must not
						part thus: </l>
					<l>Bertram, I have known thee long.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> From childhood, Signor, </l>
					<l>You have been my protector: in the days </l>
					<l>Of reckless infancy, when rank forgets, </l>
					<l>Or, rather, is not yet taught to remember </l>
					<l>Its cold prerogative, we played together; </l>
					<l>Our sports, our smiles, our tears, were mingled oft; </l>
					<l>My father was your father's client, I </l>
					<l>His son's scarce less than foster-brother; years </l>
					<l>Saw us together---happy, heart-full hours! </l>
					<l>Oh God! the difference 'twixt those hours and this!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Bertram, 'tis thou who hast forgotten them.</l>
						</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Nor now, nor ever; whatsoe'er betide, </l>
					<l>I would have saved you: when to Manhood's growth </l>
					<l>We sprung, and you, devoted to the state, </l>
					<l> As suits your station, the more humble Bertram </l>
					<l>Was left unto the labours of the humble, </l>
					<l>Still you forsook me not; and if my fortunes </l>
					<l>Have not been towering, 'twas no fault of him </l>
					<l>Who ofttimes rescued and supported me, </l>
					<l>When struggling with the tides of Circumstance, </l>
					<l>Which bear away the weaker: noble blood </l>
					<l>Ne'er mantled in a nobler heart than thine </l>
					<l>Has proved to me, the poor plebeian Bertram. </l>
					<l>Would that thy fellow Senators were like thee!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Why, what hast thou to say against the
						Senate?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Nothing.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> I know that there are angry spirits </l>
					<l>And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason, </l>
					<l>Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out </l>
					<l>Muffled to whisper curses to the night; </l>
					<l>Disbanded soldiers, discontented ruffians, </l>
					<l>And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns; </l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Thou</speaker><l> herdest not with such: 'tis true, of lateI have
						lost sight of thee, but thou wert wont </l>
					<l>To lead a temperate life, and break thy bread </l>
					<l>With honest mates, and bear a cheerful aspect. </l>
					<l>What hath come to thee? in thy hollow eye </l>
					<l>And hueless cheek, and thine unquiet motions, </l>
					<l>Sorrow and Shame and Conscience seem at war </l>
					<l> To waste thee.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Rather Shame and Sorrow light </l>
					<l>On the accurs√©d tyranny which rides </l>
					<l>The very air in Venice, and makes men </l>
					<l>Madden as in the last hours of the plague </l>
					<l>Which sweeps the soul deliriously from life!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Some villains have been tampering with thee,
						Bertram; </l>
					<l>This is not thy old language, nor own thoughts; </l>
					<l>Some wretch has made thee drunk with disaffection: </l>
					<l>But thou must not be lost so; thou</l>
					<em>wert</em>
					<l>goodAnd kind, and art not fit for such base acts </l>
					<l>As Vice and Villany would put thee to: </l>
					<l>Confess---confide in me---thou know'st my nature. </l>
					<l>What is it thou and thine are bound to do, </l>
					<l>Which should prevent thy friend, the only son </l>
					<l>Of him who was a friend unto thy father, </l>
					<l>So that our good-will is a heritage </l>
					<l>We should bequeath to our posterity </l>
					<l>Such as ourselves received it, or augmented; </l>
					<l>I say, what is it thou must do, that I </l>
					<l>Should deem thee dangerous, and keep the house </l>
					<l>Like a sick girl?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Nay, question me no further: </l>
					<l>I must be gone.---</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> And I be murdered!---say, </l>
					<l> Was it not thus thou said'st, my gentle Bertram?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Who talks of murder? what said I of murder? </l>
					<l>'Tis false! I did not utter such a word.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Thou didst not; but from out thy wolfish eye, </l>
					<l>So changed from what I knew it, there glares forth </l>
					<l>The gladiator. If</l>
					<em>my</em>
					<l>life's thine object,Take it---I am unarmed,---and then away! </l>
					<l>I would not hold my breath on such a tenure </l>
					<l>As the capricious mercy of such things </l>
					<l>As thou and those who have set thee to thy task-work.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Sooner than spill thy blood, I peril mine; </l>
					<l>Sooner than harm a hair of thine, I place </l>
					<l>In jeopardy a thousand heads, and some </l>
					<l>As noble, nay, even nobler than thine own.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Aye, is it even so? Excuse me, Bertram; </l>
					<l>I am not worthy to be singled out </l>
					<l>From such exalted hecatombs---who are they </l>
					<l>That</l>
					<em>are</em>
					<l>in danger, and that</l>
					<em>make</em>
					<l>the danger?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Venice, and all that she inherits, are </l>
					<l>Divided like a house against itself, </l>
					<l>And so will perish ere to-morrow's twilight!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>More mysteries, and awful ones! But now, </l>
					<l>Or thou, or I, or both, it may be, are </l>
					<l>Upon the verge of ruin; speak once out, </l>
					<l>And thou art safe and glorious: for 'tis more </l>
					<l> Glorious to save than slay, and slay i' the dark too--- </l>
					<l>Fie, Bertram! that was not a craft for thee! </l>
					<l>How would it look to see upon a spear </l>
					<l>The head of him whose heart was open to thee! </l>
					<l>Borne by thy hand before the shuddering people? </l>
					<l>And such may be my doom; for here I swear, </l>
					<l>Whate'er the peril or the penalty </l>
					<l>Of thy denunciation, I go forth, </l>
					<l>Unless thou dost detail the cause, and show </l>
					<l>The consequence of all which led thee here!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Is there no way to save thee? minutes fly, </l>
					<l>And thou art lost!---</l>
					<em>thou!</em>
					<l>my sole benefactor,The only being who was constant to me </l>
					<l>Through every change. Yet, make me not a traitor! </l>
					<l>Let me save thee---but spare my honour!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> Where </l>
					<l>Can lie the honour in a league of murder? </l>
					<l>And who are traitors save unto the State?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>A league is still a compact, and more binding </l>
					<l>In honest hearts when words must stand for law; </l>
					<l>And in my mind, there is no traitor like </l>
					<l>He whose domestic treason plants the poniard </l>
					<l>Within the breast which trusted to his truth.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l> And</l>
					<em>who</em>
					<l>will strike the steel to mine?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l> Not I; </l>
					<l> I could have wound my soul up to all things </l>
					<l>Save this.</l>
					<em>Thou</em>
					<l>must not die! and think how dearThy life is, when I risk so many lives, </l>
					<l>Nay, more, the Life of lives, the liberty </l>
					<l>Of future generations,</l>
					<em>not</em>
					<l>to beThe assassin thou miscall'st me:---once, once more </l>
					<l>I do adjure thee, pass not o'er thy threshold!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>It is in vain---this moment I go forth.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>Then perish Venice rather than my friend! </l>
					<l>I will disclose---ensnare---betray---destroy--- </l>
					<l>Oh, what a villain I become for thee!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Lioni.</speaker><l>Say, rather thy friend's saviour and the
						State's!--- </l>
					<l>Speak---pause not---all rewards, all pledges for </l>
					<l>Thy safety and thy welfare; wealth such as </l>
					<l>The State accords her worthiest servants; nay, </l>
					<l>Nobility itself I guarantee thee, </l>
					<l>So that thou art sincere and penitent.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber.</speaker><l>I have thought again: it must not be---I love

					<l>Thou knowest it---that I stand here is the proof, </l>
					<l>Not least though last; but having done my duty </l>
					<l>By thee, I now must do it by my country! </l>

				<stage>The <strong>Doge</strong> and his Nephew <strong>Bertuccio
					Faliero</strong></stage>
				<sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Are all the people of our house in muster?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>They are arrayed, and eager for the signal, </l>
					<l>Within our palace precincts at San Polo:I come for your last orders.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> It had been </l>
					<l>As well had there been time to have got together, </l>
					<l>From my own fief, Val di Marino, more </l>
					<l>Of our retainers---but it is too late.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Methinks, my Lord, 'tis better as it is: </l>
					<l>A sudden swelling of our retinue </l>
					<l>Had waked suspicion; and, though fierce and trusty, </l>
					<l>The vassals of that district are too rude </l>
					<l>And quick in quarrel to have long maintained </l>
					<l>The secret discipline we need for such </l>
					<l>A service, till our foes are dealt upon.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>True; but when once the signal has been given,
					</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>These</speaker><l> are the men for such an enterprise;These city
						slaves have all their private bias, </l>
					<l>Their prejudice</l>
					<em>against</em>
					<l>or</l>
					<em>for</em>
					<l>this noble,Which may induce them to o'erdo or spare </l>
					<l>Where mercy may be madness; the fierce peasants, </l>
					<l>Serfs of my county of Val di Marino, </l>
					<l>Would do the bidding of their lord without </l>
					<l>Distinguishing for love or hate his foes; </l>
					<l> Alike to them Marcello or Cornaro, </l>
					<l>A Gradenigo or a Foscari; </l>
					<l>They are not used to start at those vain names, </l>
					<l>Nor bow the knee before a civic Senate; </l>
					<l>A chief in armour is their Suzerain, </l>
					<l>And not a thing in robes.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> We are enough; </l>
					<l>And for the dispositions of our clients </l>
					<l>Against the Senate I will answer.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Well, </l>
					<l>The die is thrown; but for a warlike service, </l>
					<l>Done in the field, commend me to my peasants: </l>
					<l>They made the sun shine through the host of Huns </l>
					<l>When sallow burghers slunk back to their tents, </l>
					<l>And cowered to hear their own victorious trumpet. </l>
					<l>If there be small resistance, you will find </l>
					<l>These Citizens all Lions, like their Standard; </l>
					<l>But if there's much to do, you'll wish, with me, </l>
					<l>A band of iron rustics at our backs.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>Thus thinking, I must marvel you resolve </l>
					<l>To strike the blow so suddenly.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Such blows </l>
					<l>Must be struck suddenly or never. When </l>
					<l>I had o'ermastered the weak false remorse </l>
					<l>Which yearned about my heart, too fondly yielding </l>
					<l> A moment to the feelings of old days, </l>
					<l>I was most fain to strike; and, firstly, that </l>
					<l>I might not yield again to such emotions; </l>
					<l>And, secondly, because of all these men, </l>
					<l>Save Israel and Philip Calendaro, </l>
					<l>I know not well the courage or the faith: </l>
					<l>To-day might find 'mongst them a traitor to us, </l>
					<l>As yesterday a thousand to the Senate; </l>
					<l>But once in, with their hilts hot in their hands, </l>
					<l>They must</l>
					<em>on</em>
					<l>for their own sakes; one stroke struck,And the mere instinct of the
						first-born Cain, </l>
					<l>Which ever lurks somewhere in human hearts, </l>
					<l>Though Circumstance may keep it in abeyance, </l>
					<l>Will urge the rest on like to wolves; the sight </l>
					<l>Of blood to crowds begets the thirst of more, </l>
					<l>As the first wine-cup leads to the long revel; </l>
					<l>And you will find a harder task to quell </l>
					<l>Than urge them when they</l>
					<em>have</em>
					<l>commenced, but</l>
					<em>till</em>That moment, a mere voice, a straw, a shadow, <l>Are capable of
						turning them aside.--- </l>
					<l>How goes the night?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> Almost upon the dawn.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Then it is time to strike upon the bell. </l>
					<l>Are the men posted?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> By this time they are; </l>
					<l> But they have orders not to strike, until </l>
					<l>They have command from you through me in person.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>'Tis well.---Will the morn never put to rest </l>
					<l>These stars which twinkle yet o'er all the heavens? </l>
					<l>I am settled and bound up, and being so, </l>
					<l>The very effort which it cost me to </l>
					<l>Resolve to cleanse this Commonwealth with fire, </l>
					<l>Now leaves my mind more steady. I have wept, </l>
					<l>And trembed at the thought of this dread duty; </l>
					<l>But now I have put down all idle passion, </l>
					<l>And look the growing tempest in the face, </l>
					<l>As doth the pilot of an Admiral Galley: </l>
					<l>Yet (wouldst thou think it, kinsman?) it hath been </l>
					<l>A greater struggle to me, than when nations </l>
					<l>Beheld their fate merged in the approaching fight, </l>
					<l>Where I was leader of a phalanx, where </l>
					<l>Thousands were sure to perish---Yes, to spill </l>
					<l>The rank polluted current from the veins </l>
					<l>Of a few bloated despots needed more </l>
					<l>To steel me to a purpose such as made </l>
					<l>Timoleon immortal, than to face </l>
					<l>The toils and dangers of a life of war.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l>It gladdens me to see your former wisdom </l>
					<l>Subdue the furies which so wrung you ere </l>
					<l>You were decided.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> It was ever thus </l>
					<l>With me; the hour of agitation came </l>
					<l>In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when </l>
					<l>Passion had too much room to sway; but in </l>
					<l>The hour of action I have stood as calm </l>
					<l>As were the dead who lay around me: this </l>
					<l>They knew who made me what I am, and trusted </l>
					<l>To the subduing power which I preserved </l>
					<l>Over my mood, when its first burst was spent. </l>
					<l>But they were not aware that there are things </l>
					<l>Which make revenge a virtue by reflection, </l>
					<l>And not an impulse of mere anger; though </l>
					<l>The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls </l>
					<l>Oft do a public right with private wrong, </l>
					<l>And justify their deeds unto themselves.--- </l>
					<l>Methinks the day breaks---is it not so? look, </l>
					<l>Thine eyes are clear with youth;---the air puts on </l>
					<l>A morning freshness, and, at least to me, </l>
					<l>The sea looks greyer through the lattice.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ber. F.</speaker><l> True, </l>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Away then! </l>
					<l>See that they strike without delay, and with </l>
					<l>The first toll from St. Mark's, march on the palace </l>
					<l>With all our House's strength; here I will meet you; </l>
					<l> The Sixteen and their companies will move </l>
					<l>In separate columns at the self-same moment: </l>
					<l>Be sure you post yourself at the great Gate: </l>
					<l>I would not trust "the Ten" except to us--- </l>
					<l>The rest, the rabble of patricians, may </l>
					<l>Glut the more careless swords of those leagued with us. </l>
					<l>Remember that the cry is still "Saint Mark! </l>
					<l>The Genoese are come---ho! to the rescue! </l>
					<l>Saint Mark and Liberty!"---Now---now to action!</l> </sp><sp><speaker>Ber.

				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Come hither, my Bertuccio---one embrace; </l>
					<l>Speed, for the day grows broader; send me soon </l>
					<l>A messenger to tell me how all goes </l>

					<l> He is gone, </l>
					<l>And on each footstep moves a life. 'Tis done. </l>
					<l>Now the destroying Angel hovers o'er </l>
					<l>Venice, and pauses ere he pours the vial, </l>
					<l>Even as the eagle overlooks his prey, </l>
					<l>And for a moment, poised in middle air, </l>
					<l>Suspends the motion of his mighty wings, </l>
					<l>Then swoops with his unerring beak. Thou Day! </l>
					<l>That slowly walk'st the waters! march---march on--- </l>
					<l> I would not smite i' the dark, but rather see </l>
					<l>That no stroke errs. And you, ye blue sea waves! </l>
					<l>I have seen you dyed ere now, and deeply too, </l>
					<l>With Genoese, Saracen, and Hunnish gore, </l>
					<l>While that of Venice flowed too, but victorious: </l>
					<l>Now thou must wear an unmixed crimson; no </l>
					<l>Barbaric blood can reconcile us now </l>
					<l>Unto that horrible incarnadine, </l>
					<l>But friend or foe will roll in civic slaughter. </l>
					<l>And have I lived to fourscore years for this? </l>
					<l>I, who was named Preserver of the City? </l>
					<l>I, at whose name the million's caps were flung </l>
					<l>Into the air, and cries from tens of thousands </l>
					<l>Rose up, imploring Heaven to send me blessings, </l>
					<l>And fame, and length of days---to see this day? </l>
					<l>But this day, black within the calendar, </l>
					<l>Shall be succeeded by a bright millennium. </l>
					<l>Doge Dandolo survived to ninety summers </l>
					<l>To vanquish empires, and refuse their crown; </l>
					<l>I will resign a crown, and make the State </l>
					<l>Renew its freedom---but oh! by what means? </l>
					<l>The noble end must justify them. What </l>
					<l>Are a few drops of human blood? 'tis false, </l>
					<l>The blood of tyrants is not human; they, </l>
					<l>Like to incarnate Molochs, feed on ours, </l>
					<l> Until 'tis time to give them to the tombs </l>
					<l>Which they have made so populous.---Oh World! </l>
					<l>Oh Men! what are ye, and our best designs, </l>
					<l>That we must work by crime to punish crime? </l>
					<l>And slay as if Death had but this one gate, </l>
					<l>When a few years would make the sword superfluous? </l>
					<l>And I, upon the verge of th' unknown realm, </l>
					<l>Yet send so many heralds on before me?--- </l> I must not ponder this.
						<stage>A pause.</stage>
					<l> Hark! was there not </l>
					<l>A murmur as of distant voices, and </l>
					<l>The tramp of feet in martial unison? </l>
					<l>What phantoms even of sound our wishes raise! </l>
					<l>It cannot be---the signal hath not rung--- </l>
					<l>Why pauses it? My nephew's messenger </l>
					<l>Should be upon his way to me, and he </l>
					<l>Himself perhaps even now draws grating back </l>
					<l>Upon its ponderous hinge the steep tower portal, </l>
					<l>Where swings the sullen huge oracular bell, </l>
					<l>Which never knells but for a princely death, </l>
					<l>Or for a state in peril, pealing forth </l>
					<l>Tremendous bodements; let it do its office, </l>
					<l>And be this peal its awfullest and last </l>
					<l>Sound till the strong tower rock!---What! silent still? </l>
					<l>I would go forth, but that my post is here, </l>
					<l> To be the centre of re-union to </l>
					<l>The oft discordant elements which form </l>
					<l>Leagues of this nature, and to keep compact </l>
					<l>The wavering of the weak, in case of conflict; </l>
					<l>For if they should do battle, 'twill be here, </l>
					<l>Within the palace, that the strife will thicken: </l>

					<l>When you must doff the Ducal Bonnet from </l>

					<l>Than Empires can confer, in quiet honour, </l>
					<l>But it must plot to overthrow your peers, </l>

					<l>Show me the law!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l> On great emergencies, </l>
					<l>The law must be remodelled or amended: </l>
					<l>Our fathers had not fixed the punishment </l>
					<l>Of such a crime, as on the old Roman tables </l>
					<l>The sentence against parricide was left </l>
					<l>In pure forgetfulness; they could not render </l>
					<l>That penal, which had neither name nor thought </l>
					<l>In their great bosoms; who would have foreseen </l>
					<l>That Nature could be filed to such a crime </l>
					<l>As sons 'gainst sires, and princes 'gainst their realms? </l>
					<l>Your sin hath made us make a law which will </l>
					<l> Become a precedent 'gainst such haught traitors, </l>
					<l>As would with treason mount to tyranny; </l>
					<l>Not even contented with a sceptre, till </l>
					<l>They can convert it to a two-edged sword! </l>
					<l>Was not the place of Doge sufficient for ye? </l>

				</sp><sp><speaker>You---you</speaker><l> , who sit there, traitors as ye are!From my

					<l>And my superiority in action, </l>
					<l>You drew me from my honourable toils </l>
					<l>In distant lands---on flood, in field, in cities--- </l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>You</speaker><l> singled me out like a victim toStand crowned, but
						bound and helpless, at the altar </l>
					<l>Where you alone could minister. I knew not, </l>
					<l>I sought not, wished not, dreamed not the election, </l>
					<l>Which reached me first at Rome, and I obeyed; </l>
					<l>But found on my arrival, that, besides </l>
					<l>The jealous vigilance which always led you </l>
					<l>To mock and mar your Sovereign's best intents, </l>
					<l>You had, even in the interregnum of </l>
					<l>My journey to the capital, curtailed </l>
					<l>And mutilated the few privileges </l>
					<l>Yet left the Duke: all this I bore, and would </l>
					<l>Have borne, until my very hearth was stained </l>
					<l> By the pollution of your ribaldry, </l>

					<l>One of the Forty; "the Ten" having craved </l>
					<l>A Giunta of patricians from the Senate </l>
					<l>To aid our judgment in a trial arduous </l>
					<l>And novel as the present: he was set </l>
					<l>Free from the penalty pronounced upon him, </l>
					<l>Because the Doge, who should protect the law, </l>
					<l>Seeking to abrogate all law, can claim </l>
					<l>No punishment of others by the statutes </l>
					<l>Which he himself denies and violates!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>His <strong>punishment</strong>!</l>
					<l>I rather see him <em>there</em>,</l>
					<l>Where he now sits, to glut him with my death, </l>
					<l>Than in the mockery of castigation, </l>
					<l>Which your foul, outward, juggling show of justice </l>
					<l>Decreed as sentence! Base as was his crime, </l>
					<l>'Twas purity compared with your protection.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>And can it be, that the great Doge of Venice, </l>
					<l>With three parts of a century of years </l>
					<l>And honours on his head, could thus allow </l>
					<l>His fury, like an angry boy's, to master </l>
					<l>All Feeling, Wisdom, Faith and Fear, on such </l>
					<l> A provocation as a young man's petulance?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>A spark creates the flame---'tis the last drop </l>
					<l>Which makes the cup run o'er, and mine was full </l>
					<l>Already: you oppressed the Prince and people; </l>
					<l>I would have freed both, and have failed in both: </l>
					<l>The price of such success would have been glory, </l>
					<l>Vengeance, and victory, and such a name </l>
					<l>As would have made Venetian history </l>
					<l>Rival to that of Greece and Syracuse </l>
					<l>When they were freed, and flourished ages after, </l>
					<l>And mine to Gelon and to Thrasybulus: </l>
					<l>Failing, I know the penalty of failure </l>
					<l>Is present infamy and death---the future </l>
					<l>Will judge, when Venice is no more, or free; </l>
					<l>Till then, the truth is in abeyance. Pause not; </l>
					<l>I would have shown no mercy, and I seek none; </l>
					<l>My life was staked upon a mighty hazard, </l>
					<l>And being lost, take what I would have taken! </l>
					<l>I would have stood alone amidst your tombs: </l>
					<l>Now you may flock round mine, and trample on it, </l>
					<l>As you have done upon my heart while living.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>You do confess then, and admit the justice </l>
					<l>Of our Tribunal?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I confess to have failed; </l>
					<l>Fortune is female: from my youth her favours </l>
					<l> Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope </l>
					<l>Her former smiles again at this late hour.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>You do not then in aught arraign our equity?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Noble Venetians! stir me not with questions. </l>
					<l>I am resigned to the worst; but in me still </l>
					<l>Have something of the blood of brighter days, </l>
					<l>And am not over-patient. Pray you, spare me </l>
					<l>Further interrogation, which boots nothing, </l>
					<l>Except to turn a trial to debate. </l>
					<l>I shall but answer that which will offend you, </l>
					<l>And please your enemies---a host already; </l>
					<l>'Tis true, these sullen walls should yield no echo: </l>
					<l>But walls have ears---nay, more, they have tongues; and if </l>
					<l>There were no other way for Truth to o'erleap them, </l>
					<l>You who condemn me, you who fear and slay me, </l>
					<l>Yet could not bear in silence to your graves </l>
					<l>What you would hear from me of Good or Evil; </l>
					<l>The secret were too mighty for your souls: </l>
					<l>Then let it sleep in mine, unless you court </l>
					<l>A danger which would double that you escape. </l>
					<l>Such my defence would be, had I full scope </l>
					<l>To make it famous; for true</l>
					<em>words</em>
					<l>are</l>
					<em>things</em>
					<l>,And dying men's are things which long outlive, </l>
					<l>And oftentimes avenge them; bury mine, </l>
					<l>If ye would fain survive me: take this counsel, </l>
					<l> And though too oft ye make me live in wrath, </l>
					<l>Let me die calmly; you may grant me this; </l>
					<l>I deny nothing---defend nothing---nothing </l>
					<l>I ask of you, but silence for myself, </l>
					<l>And sentence from the Court!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l> This full admission </l>
					<l>Spares us the harsh necessity of ordering </l>
					<l>The torture to elicit the whole truth.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>The torture! you have put me there already, </l>
					<l>Daily since I was Doge; but if you will </l>
					<l>Add the corporeal rack, you may: these limbs </l>

				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>Lady! the natural distraction of </l>

					<l>Merit forgiveness; else a doubt like this </l>

					<l>Could cancel the inexorable past! </l>
					<l>But since that cannot be, as Christians let us </l>
					<l>Say farewell, and in peace: with full contrition </l>
					<l> I crave, not pardon, but compassion from you, </l>
					<l>And give, however weak, my prayers for both.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Sage Benintende, now chief Judge of Venice, </l>
					<l>I speak to thee in answer to yon Signor. </l>
					<l>Inform the ribald Steno, that his words </l>
					<l>Ne'er weighed in mind with Loredano's daughter, </l>
					<l>Further than to create a moment's pity </l>
					<l>For such as he is: would that others had </l>
					<l>Despised him as I pity! I prefer </l>
					<l>My honour to a thousand lives, could such </l>
					<l>Be multiplied in mine, but would not have </l>
					<l>A single life of others lost for that </l>
					<l>Which nothing human can impugn---the sense </l>
					<l>Of Virtue, looking not to what is called </l>
					<l>A good name for reward, but to itself. </l>
					<l>To me the scorner's words were as the wind </l>
					<l>Unto the rock: but as there are---alas! </l>
					<l>Spirits more sensitive, on which such things </l>
					<l>Light as the Whirlwind on the waters; souls </l>
					<l>To whom dishonour's shadow is a substance </l>
					<l>More terrible than Death, here and hereafter; </l>
					<l>Men whose vice is to start at Vice's scoffing, </l>
					<l>And who, though proof against all blandishments </l>
					<l>Of pleasure, and all pangs of Pain, are feeble </l>
					<l>When the proud name on which they pinnacled </l>
					<l> Their hopes is breathed on, jealous as the eagle </l>
					<l>Of her high aiery; let what we now </l>
					<l>Behold, and feel, and suffer, be a lesson </l>
					<l>To wretches how they tamper in their spleen </l>
					<l>With beings of a higher order. Insects </l>
					<l>Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft </l>
					<l>I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave; </l>
					<l>A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy; </l>
					<l>A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever; </l>
					<l>An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium, </l>
					<l>And thence to Rome, which perished for a time; </l>
					<l>An obscene gesture cost Caligula </l>
					<l>His life, while Earth yet bore his cruelties; </l>
					<l>A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province; </l>
					<l>And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines, </l>
					<l>Hath decimated Venice, put in peril </l>
					<l>A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years, </l>
					<l>Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head, </l>
					<l>And forged new fetters for a groaning people! </l>
					<l>Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan </l>
					<l>Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this, </l>
					<l>If it so please him---'twere a pride fit for him! </l>
					<l>But let him not insult the last hours of </l>
					<l>Him, who, whate'er he now is,</l>
					<em>was</em>
					<l>a Hero,By the intrusion of his very prayers; </l>
					<l> Nothing of good can come from such a source, </l>
					<l>Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever: </l>
					<l>We leave him to himself, that lowest depth </l>
					<l>Of human baseness. Pardon is for men, </l>
					<l>And not for reptiles---we have none for Steno, </l>
					<l>And no resentment: things like him must sting, </l>
					<l>And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter </l>
					<l>Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang </l>
					<l>May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger: </l>

					<l>Count of Val di Marino, Senator, </l>
					<l>And some time General of the Fleet and Army, </l>

					<l> Intrusted by the state with high employments, </l>
					<l>Even to the highest, listen to the sentence. </l>
					<l>Convict by many witnesses and proofs, </l>
					<l>And by thine own confession, of the guilt </l>
					<l>Of Treachery and Treason, yet unheard of </l>
					<l>Until this trial---the decree is Death--- </l>
					<l>Thy goods are confiscate unto the State, </l>
					<l>Thy name is razed from out her records, save </l>
					<l>Upon a public day of thanksgiving </l>
					<l>For this our most miraculous deliverance, </l>
					<l>When thou art noted in our calendars </l>
					<l>With earthquakes, pestilence, and foreign foes, </l>
					<l>And the great Enemy of man, as subject </l>
					<l>Of grateful masses for Heaven's grace in snatching </l>
					<l>Our lives and country from thy wickedness. </l>
					<l>The place wherein as Doge thou shouldst be painted </l>
					<l>With thine illustrious predecessors, is </l>
					<l>To be left vacant, with a death-black veil </l>
					<l>Flung over these dim words engraved beneath,--- </l>
					<l>"This place is of Marino Faliero, </l>
					<l>Decapitated for his crimes."</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> "His</l>

					<l>But let it be so:---it will be in vain. </l>
					<l>The veil which blackens o'er this blighted name, </l>
					<l>And hides, or seems to hide, these lineaments, </l>
					<l> Shall draw more gazers than the thousand portraits </l>
					<l>Which glitter round it in their pictured trappings--- </l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Your</speaker><l> delegated slaves---the people's tyrants!</l>
					<l>"Decapitated for his crimes!"---</l>

					<l>So that the contemplator might approve, </l>
					<l>Or at the least learn</l>
					<em>whence</em>
					<l>the crimes arose?When the beholder knows a Doge conspired, </l>
					<l>Let him be told the cause---it is your history.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>Time must reply to that; our sons will judge </l>
					<l>Their fathers' judgment, which I now pronounce. </l>
					<l>As Doge, clad in the ducal robes and Cap, </l>
					<l>Thou shalt be led hence to the Giants' Staircase, </l>
					<l>Where thou and all our Princes are invested; </l>
					<l>And there, the Ducal Crown being first resumed </l>
					<l>Upon the spot where it was first assumed, </l>

					<l>Upon thy soul!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> Is this the Giunta's sentence?</l>

					<l>And goods, and jewels, and all kind of treasure, </l>
					<l>Except two thousand ducats---these dispose of.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>That's harsh.---I would have fain reserved the

					<l>Near to Treviso, which I hold by investment </l>
					<l>From Laurence the Count-bishop of Ceneda, </l>
					<l>In fief perpetual to myself and heirs, </l>
					<l>To portion them (leaving my city spoil, </l>
					<l>My palace and my treasures, to your forfeit) </l>
					<l>Between my consort and my kinsmen.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l> These </l>
					<l>Lie under the state's ban---their Chief, thy nephew, </l>
					<l>In peril of his own life; but the Council </l>
					<l>Postpones his trial for the present. If </l>

					<l>Fear not, for we will do her justice.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Signors, </l>

					<l>The hour may be a hard one, but 'twill end. </l>
					<l>Have I aught else to undergo save Death?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l>You have nought to do, except confess and die. </l>
					<l> The priest is robed, the scimitar is bare, </l>
					<l>And both await without.---But, above all, </l>
					<l>Think not to speak unto the people; they </l>
					<l>Are now by thousands swarming at the gates, </l>
					<l>But these are closed: the Ten, the Avogadori, </l>
					<l>The Giunta, and the chief men of the Forty, </l>
					<l>Alone will be beholders of thy doom, </l>
					<l>And they are ready to attend the Doge.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>The Doge!</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ben.</speaker><l> Yes, Doge, thou hast lived and thou shalt die </l>
					<l>A Sovereign; till the moment which precedes </l>
					<l>The separation of that head and trunk, </l>
					<l>That ducal crown and head shall be united. </l>
					<l>Thou hast forgot thy dignity in deigning </l>
					<l>To plot with petty traitors; not so we, </l>
					<l>Who in the very punishment acknowledge </l>
					<l>The Prince. Thy vile accomplices have died </l>
					<l>The dog's death, and the wolf's; but thou shalt fall </l>

					<l>By those who feel a proud compassion for thee, </l>
					<l>And mourn even the inevitable death </l>
					<l>Provoked by thy wild wrath, and regal fierceness. </l>
					<l>Now we remit thee to thy preparation: </l>
					<l>Let it be brief, and we ourselves will be </l>
					<l>Thy guides unto the place where first we were </l>
					<l> United to thee as thy subjects, and </l>

				<sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Now, that the priest is gone, 'twere useless all </l>
					<l>To linger out the miserable minutes; </l>
					<l>But one pang more, the pang of parting from thee, </l>
					<l>And I will leave the few last grains of sand, </l>
					<l>Which yet remain of the accorded hour, </l>
					<l>Still falling---I have done with Time.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> Alas! </l>
					<l>And I have been the cause, the unconscious cause; </l>
					<l>And for this funeral marriage, this black union, </l>
					<l>Which thou, compliant with my father's wish, </l>
					<l>Didst promise at</l>
					<em>his</em>
					<l>death, thou hast sealed thine own.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Not so: there was that in my spirit ever </l>
					<l>Which shaped out for itself some great reverse; </l>
					<l>The marvel is, it came not until now--- </l>
					<l>And yet it was foretold me.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l> How foretold you?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>Long years ago---so long, they are a doubt </l>
					<l>In memory, and yet they live in annals: </l>
					<l>When I was in my youth, and served the Senate </l>
					<l>And Signory as Podesta and Captain </l>
					<l>Of the town of Treviso, on a day </l>
					<l>Of festival, the sluggish Bishop who </l>
					<l>Conveyed the Host aroused my rash young anger, </l>
					<l>By strange delay, and arrogant reply </l>
					<l> To my reproof: I raised my hand and smote him, </l>
					<l>Until he reeled beneath his holy burthen; </l>
					<l>And as he rose from earth again, he raised </l>
					<l>His tremulous hands in pious wrath towards Heaven. </l>
					<l>Thence pointing to the Host, which had fallen from him, </l>
					<l>He turned to me, and said, "The Hour will come </l>
					<l>When he thou hast o'erthrown shall overthrow thee: </l>
					<l>The Glory shall depart from out thy house, </l>
					<l>The Wisdom shall be shaken from thy soul, </l>
					<l>And in thy best maturity of Mind </l>
					<l>A madness of the heart shall seize upon thee; </l>
					<l>Passion shall tear thee when all passions cease </l>
					<l>In other men, or mellow into virtues; </l>
					<l>And Majesty which decks all other heads, </l>
					<l>Shall crown to leave thee headless; honours shall </l>
					<l>But prove to thee the heralds of Destruction, </l>
					<l>And hoary hairs of Shame, and both of Death, </l>
					<l>But not such death as fits an ag√©d man." </l>
					<l>Thus saying, he passed on.---That Hour is come.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>And with this warning couldst thou not have
						striven </l>
					<l>To avert the fatal moment, and atone, </l>
					<l>By penitence, for that which thou hadst done?</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I own the words went to my heart, so much </l>
					<l>That I remembered them amid the maze </l>
					<l>Of Life, as if they formed a spectral voice, </l>
					<l> Which shook me in a supernatural dream; </l>
					<l>And I repented; but 'twas not for me </l>
					<l>To pull in resolution: what must be </l>
					<l>I could not change, and would not fear.---Nay more, </l>
					<l>Thou can'st not have forgot, what all remember, </l>
					<l>That on my day of landing here as Doge, </l>
					<l>On my return from Rome, a mist of such </l>
					<l>Unwonted density went on before </l>
					<l>The Bucentaur, like the columnar cloud </l>
					<l>Which ushered Israel out of Egypt, till </l>
					<l>The pilot was misled, and disembarked us </l>
					<l>Between the Pillars of Saint Mark's, where 'tis </l>
					<l>The custom of the state to put to death </l>
					<l>Its criminals, instead of touching at </l>
					<l>The Riva della Paglia, as the wont is,--- </l>
					<l>So that all Venice shuddered at the omen.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Ah! little boots it now to recollect </l>
					<l>Such things.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> And yet I find a comfort in </l>
					<l>The thought, that these things are the work of Fate; </l>
					<l>For I would rather yield to Gods than men, </l>
					<l>Or cling to any creed of destiny, </l>
					<l>Rather than deem these mortals, most of whom </l>
					<l>I know to be as worthless as the dust, </l>
					<l>And weak as worthless, more than instruments </l>
					<l> Of an o'er-ruling Power; they in themselves </l>
					<l>Were all incapable---they could not be </l>
					<l>Victors of him who oft had conquered for them.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Employ the minutes left in aspirations </l>
					<l>Of a more healing nature, and in peace </l>
					<l>Even with these wretches take thy flight to Heaven.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l> I</l>
					<em>am</em>
					<l>at peace: the peace of certaintyThat a sure Hour will come, when their sons'
						sons, </l>
					<l>And this proud city, and these azure waters, </l>
					<l>And all which makes them eminent and bright, </l>
					<l>Shall be a desolation and a curse, </l>
					<l>A hissing and a scoff unto the nations, </l>
					<l>A Carthage, and a Tyre, an Ocean Babel.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Ang.</speaker><l>Speak not thus now: the surge of Passion still </l>
					<l>Sweeps o'er thee to the last; thou dost deceive </l>
					<l>Thyself, and canst not injure them---be calmer.</l>
				</sp><sp><speaker>Doge.</speaker><l>I stand within Eternity, and see </l>

					<l>A fond but fatal husband---love my memory--- </l>
					<l>I would not ask so much for me still living, </l>

					<l>Which generally leave some flowers to bloom </l>
					<l>Even o'er the grave, I have nothing left, not even </l>
					<l>A little love, or friendship, or esteem, </l>
					<l>No, not enough to extract an epitaph </l>
					<l>From ostentatious kinsmen; in one hour </l>
					<l>I have uprooted all my former life, </l>
					<l>And outlived everything, except thy heart, </l>
					<l>The pure, the good, the gentle, which will oft </l>
					<l>With unimpaired but not a clamorous grief </l>
					<l>Still keep---Thou turn'st so pale!---Alas! she faints, </l>
					<l>She has no breath, no pulse!---Guards! lend your aid--- </l>
					<l>I cannot leave her thus, and yet 'tis better, </l>
					<l>Since every lifeless moment spares a pang. </l>
					<l>When she shakes off this temporary death, </l>

					<l>When she, who built 'gainst Attila a bulwark, </l>
					<l>Shall yield, and bloodlessly and basely yield, </l>
					<l>Unto a bastard Attila, without </l>
					<l>Shedding so much blood in her last defence, </l>

					<l>Round a barbarian Vice of Kings' Vice-gerent, </l>
					<l>Even in the Palace where they swayed as Sovereigns, </l>
					<l>Even in the Palace where they slew their Sovereign, </l>
					<l>Proud of some name they have disgraced, or sprung </l>
					<l> From an adulteress boastful of her guilt </l>
					<l>With some large gondolier or foreign soldier, </l>
					<l>Shall bear about their bastardy in triumph </l>
					<l>To the third spurious generation;---when </l>

					<l>Defy all codes to image or to name them; </l>
					<l>Then, when of Cyprus, now thy subject kingdom, </l>
					<l>All thine inheritance shall be her shame </l>
					<l>Entailed on thy less virtuous daughters, grown </l>
					<l>A wider proverb for worse prostitution;--- </l>
					<l>When all the ills of conquered states shall cling thee, </l>
					<l>Vice without splendour, Sin without relief </l>
					<l>Even from the gloss of Love to smooth it o'er, </l>
					<l>But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude,</l>
					<l>Prurient yet passionless, cold studied lewdness, </l>
					<l>Depraving Nature's frailty to an art;--- </l>
					<l>When these and more are heavy on thee, when </l>

					<l>Youth without Honour, Age without respect, </l>
					<l>Meanness and Weakness, and a sense of woe </l>
					<l>'Gainst which thou wilt not strive, and dar'st not murmur,</l>
