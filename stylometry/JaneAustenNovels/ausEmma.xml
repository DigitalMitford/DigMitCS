                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Emma Woodhouse, handsome,
                        clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to
                        unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly
                        twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex
                        her.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">She was the youngest of the
                        two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in
                        consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very
                        early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an
                        indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by
                        an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in
                        affection.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Sixteen years had Miss Taylor
                        been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond
                        of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between <hi rend="italic"
                            >them</hi> it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor
                        had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her
                        temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of
                        authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as
                        friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she
                        liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her
                        own.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">The real evils, indeed, of
                        Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a
                        disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the
                        disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger,
                        however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank
                        as misfortunes with her.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Sorrow came&#8212; — a gentle
                        sorrow&#8212; — but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable
                        consciousness.&#8212;Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which
                        first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that
                        Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and
                        the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together,
                        with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed
                        himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and
                        think of what she had lost.</said></p>

                        happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character,
                        easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some
                        satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she
                        had always wished and promoted the match;</said>

                        natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from
                        intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion
                        for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or
                    playful.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">The evil of the actual
                        disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much
                        increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian
                        all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in
                        ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of
                        his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him
                        at any time.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Her sister, though
                        comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only
                        sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily reach; and many a long October
                        and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before
                        Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband, and their
                        little children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant society
                        again.</said></p>

                        of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded
                        her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up
                        to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was
                        universally civil, but</said>

                        who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day.</said>
                    <said who="aus.005.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">It was a melancholy change;
                        and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till
                        her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required
                        support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he
                        was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.
                        Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by
                        no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak
                        of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of
                        affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from
                        his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that
                        other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed
                        to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and
                        would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her
                        life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to
                        keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him
                        not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</said></p>

                        wish she were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of

                        it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very
                        sure he will always like going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being
                        housemaid there. I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.
                        That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of

                        of her. It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself
                        slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant:
                        she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever
                        I see her, she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty
                        manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she
                        always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am
                        sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to
                        poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see.
                        Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing

                        Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three
                        generations had been rising into gentility and property. He had received a
                        good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence,
                        had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his
                        brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social
                        temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Captain Weston was a general
                        favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to
                        Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love
                        with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had
                        never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the
                        connexion would offend.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Miss Churchill, however,
                        being of age, and with the full command of her fortune&#8212; — though her
                        fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate &#8212;was not to be
                        dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite
                        mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum.
                        It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. Mrs.
                        Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm
                        heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for
                        the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of
                        spirit, she had not the best. She had resolution enough to pursue her own
                        will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable
                        regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries
                        of her former home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing
                        in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she
                        wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of
                        Enscombe.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Captain Weston, who had been
                        considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match,
                        was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died,
                        after a three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and
                        with a child to maintain. From the expense of the child, however, he was
                        soon relieved. The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a
                        lingering illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of
                        reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,
                        nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take
                        the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples
                        and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as
                        they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the
                        care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to
                        seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">A complete change of life
                        became desirable. He quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having
                        brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him a
                        favourable opening. It was a concern which brought just employment enough.
                        He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were
                        spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next
                        eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that
                        time, realised an easy competence&#8212; — enough to secure the purchase of
                        a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for&#8212; —
                        enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live
                        according to the wishes of his own friendly and social
                    disposition.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">It was now some time since
                        Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the
                        tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of
                        never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was
                        long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in
                        view, till they were accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his
                        house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence,
                        with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.
                        He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,
                        even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a
                        well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the
                        pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be
                        chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">He had only himself to please
                        in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to Frank, it was more than
                        being tacitly brought up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an
                        adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. It
                        was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's
                        assistance. His father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious
                        woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's
                        nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so
                        dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in
                        London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine
                        young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked
                        on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a
                        kind of common concern.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Mr. Frank Churchill was one
                        of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed,
                        though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in
                        his life. His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never
                        achieved.</said></p>

                        marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that
                        the visit should take place. There was not a dissentient voice on the
                        subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when
                        Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank
                        Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was
                        understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. For a few
                        days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome
                        letter Mrs. Weston had received.</said>

                        his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every
                        expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured. She
                        felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know
                        how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a

                        And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from
                        Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr.

                        and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could
                        command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he
                        liked. He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his
                        horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any
                        acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for
                        him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in
                        the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not
                        unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the
                        best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and,
                        unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely
                        an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for
                        him.</said></p>

                        tea and quadrille. She lived with her single daughter in a very small way,
                        and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old
                        lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a
                        most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome,
                        rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the
                        world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual
                        superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate
                        her into outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.
                        Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted
                        to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go
                        as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one
                        named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will and contented
                        temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested in
                        every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits;</said>

                        chilblains with her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young
                        couple now walked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of

                        the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.

                        scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of
                        her history. She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at
                        Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some

                        Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost

                        their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a
                        walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find
                        her. In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never
                        went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him
                        for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's
                        marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once
                        alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,

                        you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted
                        with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without

                        up my opinion against yours&#8212;and I am sure I shall not wish for the

                        Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,

                        loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth

                        Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have
                        more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an
                        openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body
                        likes in <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, because there is so much good-humour
                        with it&#8212;but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr.

                        situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about
                        copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young
                        man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton
                        is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown
                        particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of
                        ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but
                        it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means
                        any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you

                        We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for
                        Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate
                        with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.
                        You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a
                        companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman
                        feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her
                        life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior
                        young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma
                        wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read
                        more herself. They will read together. She means it, I know."</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.005.george">"Emma has been meaning to
                        read more ever since she was twelve years old. I have seen a great many
                        lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read
                        regularly through&#8212; and very good lists they were &#8212;very well
                        chosen, and very neatly arranged&#8212; sometimes alphabetically, and
                        sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up when only fourteen&#8212;
                        I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it
                        some time; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now. But I
                        have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She will
                        never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection
                        of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I
                        may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.&#8212;You never could
                        persuade her to read half so much as you wished.&#8212;You know you could

                            spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. At ten years old, she had
                            the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her
                            sister at seventeen. She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and
                            diffident. And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the
                            house and of you all. In her mother she lost the only person able to
                            cope with her. She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.005.george">"Not I, indeed. I only name
                        possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and
                        guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit,
                        and a Churchill in fortune.&#8212;But Harriet Smith&#8212;I have not half
                        done about Harriet Smith. I think her the very worst sort of companion that
                        Emma could possibly have. She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as
                        knowing every thing. She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the
                        worse, because undesigned. Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma
                        imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such
                        a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that <hi

                        only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to. She
                        will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom
                        birth and circumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's
                        doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt
                        herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.&#8212;They
                        only give a little polish."</said></p>

                        as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others
                        deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher

                            &#8212;but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that
                            I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore.
                            Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston!
                            always my kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I
                            asked her. There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant
                            figure!&#8212;and the face not unlike. I should have made a good
                            likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a
                            hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet.
                            Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four
                            children;&#8212;there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end
                            of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of
                            the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse;
                            but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still
                            you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond
                            the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of
                            mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a
                            baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a
                            likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down
                            his head most conveniently. That's very like. I am rather proud of
                            little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my

                        well judging. He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what
                        they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage. He is an excellent
                        young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to
                        marry. He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the case, I
                        was convinced he could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and
                        altogether sent him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion
                        before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the
                        house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened
                        the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow
                        much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear to
                        have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.
                        Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him

                            Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet
                            Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion
                            higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of nobody knows
                            whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no
                            respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder at a common
                            school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She
                            has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have
                            acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have no experience, and
                            with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail
                            her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all. My only
                            scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being beneath his
                            deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that, as to fortune, in all
                            probability he might do much better; and that as to a rational companion
                            or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I could not reason so to
                            a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her,
                            to her having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his,
                            might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the
                            match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor
                            have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good
                            luck. Even <hi rend="italic">your</hi> satisfaction I made sure of. It

                        not a clever girl, but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does
                        not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that
                        point, however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty
                        and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,
                        they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in
                        fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of

                        loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of
                        having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be
                        nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as
                        it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble
                        opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I

                        not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy
                        contemptible to a generous public! A single woman, with a very narrow
                        income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of
                        boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,
                        and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is
                        not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as
                        appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the
                        mind, and sour the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce
                        in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal
                        and cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good
                        natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the
                        taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has
                        not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the
                        world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is
                        afraid of her: that is a great charm."</said></p>

                        is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from her is read
                        forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round and round again;
                        and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair
                        of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month. I

                        boot, she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by
                        a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her
                        pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child,
                        and talk to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or
                        would have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without
                        design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without
                        any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,
                        involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she
                        was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation
                        which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet
                        listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on,
                        was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both
                        looked around, and she was obliged to join them.</said></p>

                        account of the yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come

                        chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it
                        immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed

                        however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in
                        incessant conversation, she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse
                        his own subject in the adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear

                        quicken his measures. The coming of her sister's family was so very near at
                        hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth
                        her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at

                        hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the more

                        vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell
                        Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for

                        could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake;
                        and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in
                        forestalling this too short visit.</said></p>

                        but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,
                        and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number
                        of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of

                        variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which
                        his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much
                        longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her
                        father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal
                        solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their
                        having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and

                        without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a
                        disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance on
                        them.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Mrs. John Knightley was a
                        pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition
                        remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife,
                        a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that,
                        but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She
                        could never see a fault in any of them. She was not a woman of strong
                        understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she
                        inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,
                        over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and
                        was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr.
                        Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong
                        habit of regard for every old acquaintance.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Mr. John Knightley was a
                        tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession,
                        domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved
                        manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being
                        sometimes out of humour. He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often
                        unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his
                        great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly
                        possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme
                        sweetness of her temper must hurt his. He had all the clearness and
                        quickness of mind which she wanted, and he could sometimes act an
                        ungracious, or say a severe thing.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">He was not a great favourite
                        with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him escaped her. She was quick
                        in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt
                        herself. Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been
                        flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind
                        brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any
                        degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that
                        greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of
                        respectful forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the
                        patience that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and
                        fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp
                        retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley
                        had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong
                        sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity,
                        especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be
                        endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit
                        displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so
                        short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been
                        long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the
                        head and a sigh, called his daughter's attention to the sad change at
                        Hartfield since she had been there last.</said></p>

                    nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was. To her it was real
                    enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there
                    was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his
                    wife; not any one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to
                    and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little
                    affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.
                    She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively
                    concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little
                    matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the
                    first gratifications of each.</p>

                        cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had
                        been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the
                        history of his own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and
                        had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come
                        and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had
                        been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away
                        and welcome her dear Emma.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Emma's project of forgetting
                        Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken
                        their places, that he was close to her. The difficulty was great of driving
                        his strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only
                        sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her
                        notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of
                        forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal
                        suggestion of</said>

                        insufferable!"&#8212;</said>
                    <said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Yet he would be so anxious
                        for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and
                        so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings
                        with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be
                        lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners. For
                        her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all
                        would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an
                        effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most
                        overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished
                        to listen to. She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some
                        information about his son; she heard the words</said>

                        favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she could not go to church. Mr.
                        Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it, and she
                        was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most
                        unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that
                        unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most
                        unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every
                        evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most honourable
                        prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for
                        her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses

                        have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,
                        too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather

                        of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly
                        cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed
                        him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and
                        obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of
                        cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an
                        evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it

                        nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a very useful note, for it

                        was.&#8212;She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so

                        did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of. The affection
                        of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a

                        and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding &#8212;really
                        for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the
                        two&#8212;and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and
                        happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.</said></p>

                        repressing imagination all the rest of her life. Her second duty now,
                        inferior only to her father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and
                        endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by
                        match-making. She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying
                        kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,
                        to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.</said></p>

                        sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her
                        reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all
                        hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time
                        of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common

                        those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and
                        selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have

                        rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at

                            imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in
                            situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be
                            making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him

                        make it, in a proper manner &#8212;would do him more good, raise him higher,

                        line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to
                        affection. They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who
                        had done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as
                        well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay
                        this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it,
                        are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their
                        whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in
                        this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little
                        minds would bend to his."</said></p>

                        very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich
                        people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they
                        are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you
                        are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr.
                        Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do just what you
                        have been recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The

                        no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him
                        who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect
                        independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at
                        nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can
                        have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to
                        it."</said></p>

                        habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting
                        expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As
                        he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that
                        was unworthy in their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt
                        on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there

                            though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,
                            complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's

                        He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and
                        falsehoods, and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method
                        in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having
                        any right to complain. His letters disgust me."</said></p>

                        affection to blind her. It is on her account that attention to Randalls is
                        doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission. Had she been a person of
                        consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would not have

                        not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be
                        very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of

                        Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and
                        mother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over
                        till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again&#8212;for till
                        she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week,
                        which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to
                        say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter
                        to her mother&#8212;or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but
                        we shall see presently in Jane's letter&#8212; wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as
                        well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give
                        them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat,
                        Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its
                        beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean &#8212;I do not know that she ever heard
                        about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he
                        should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his
                        addresses&#8212;and as Jane used to be very often walking out with
                        them&#8212; for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their
                        daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at
                        all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss
                        Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that
                        he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken
                        himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite
                        longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things."</said></p>

                        when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden
                        whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed
                        into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, with the
                        greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit&#8212; (I can never

                        upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.
                        Just like her! so considerate!&#8212;</said>

                        no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure

                        next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to
                        Holyhead the Monday following&#8212;as you will find from Jane's letter. So
                        sudden!&#8212;You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has
                        thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her illness &#8212;but I am
                        afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must
                        tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a
                        point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them
                        aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to
                        distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began
                        to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her
                        being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane
                        is ill!'&#8212;which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and
                        was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so
                        bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that
                        she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off
                        my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The
                        expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of
                        Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance,
                        we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to
                        maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given
                        you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am
                        sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for
                        her."</said></p>

                        remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action
                        abroad&#8212;of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon
                        afterwards&#8212; and this girl.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">By birth she belonged to
                        Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing her mother, she became the
                        property, the charge, the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and
                        aunt, there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed
                        there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command, and
                        growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted
                        on what nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and
                        warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">But the compassionate
                        feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny. This was
                        Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent
                        officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him
                        for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved
                        his life. These were claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some
                        years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to
                        England put any thing in his power. When he did return, he sought out the
                        child and took notice of her. He was a married man, with only one living
                        child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them
                        long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years
                        old, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real
                        friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the
                        whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane
                        had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely,
                        only visiting her grandmother from time to time.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">The plan was that she should
                        be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she
                        inherited from her father making independence impossible. To provide for her
                        otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay
                        and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his
                        daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the
                        means of respectable subsistence hereafter.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Such was Jane Fairfax's
                        history. She had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the
                        Campbells, and been given an excellent education. Living constantly with
                        right-minded and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had
                        received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's
                        residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice
                        to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities
                        were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or
                        nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care
                        of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she
                        was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could
                        promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It
                        was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with
                        them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an
                        elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only
                        the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own good
                        understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">The affection of the whole
                        family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more
                        honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority
                        both in beauty and acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could
                        not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be
                        unfelt by the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however,
                        till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so
                        often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what
                        is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr.
                        Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were
                        acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet
                        her bread to earn.</said></p>

                        reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning. She had
                        long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude
                        of a devoted novitiate, she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the
                        sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational
                        intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for

                        this would be selfishness:&#8212;what must be at last, had better be

                        must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any

                        herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career
                        of laborious duty.</said></p>

                        into its usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as
                        tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now
                        added to admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description
                        of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small
                        a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and
                        new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.
                        They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which
                        necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air of
                        greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior

                        determined to hazard nothing. She was disgustingly, was suspiciously

                        nothing delineated or distinguished. It did her no service however. Her
                        caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first

                        increased; and before their first conversation was over, she had talked
                        herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and

                        dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what

                        visiting. Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs.
                        Goddard's, her evil stars had led her to the very spot where, at that
                        moment, a trunk, directed to <hi rend="italic">The Rev. Philip Elton,
                            White-Hart, Bath</hi>, was to be seen under the operation of being
                        lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches
                        past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction,
                        was consequently a blank.</said></p>

                        the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn
                        before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they

                        curiosity, which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the
                        proposed quarter of an hour. She went on herself, to give that portion of

                        seemed to take very cordially. He had been sitting with her, it appeared,
                        most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being

                        Highbury, would be his constant attraction."&#8212;</said>

                        house together, arm in arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially
                        to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her
                        opinion of him was to depend.</said>

                        nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her
                        &#8212;nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a
                        friend and securing her affection.</said>

                        for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest
                        of the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour or
                        two&#8212; first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in
                        Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently
                        for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,
                        confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found
                        matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have
                        supposed.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Some of the objects of his
                        curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He begged to be shewn the house which
                        his father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his father's
                        father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still
                        living, walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the
                        other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no
                        positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in
                        general, which must be very like a merit to those he was with.</said></p>

                        feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he had been

                        making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly
                        had not done him justice.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">Their first pause was at the
                        Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort,
                        where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of
                        the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had not
                        expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it
                        they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built
                        many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a
                        particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as
                        such;&#8212;but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the
                        highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club
                        established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was
                        immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead
                        of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed
                        windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and
                        lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault in the
                        room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested.</said>

                        the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of
                        the room?&#8212;She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper
                        families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its
                        immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was

                        the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place
                        the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and
                        Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so
                        decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.</said>

                        indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion
                        of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He could be no judge,
                        however, of the evil he was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively

                        silly young man. If he were, he would have done this differently. He would
                        either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would
                        have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too
                        weak to defend its own vanities.&#8212;No, I am perfectly sure that he is

                        consequence she could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks
                        of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and
                        wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as

                        conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked
                        over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of
                        her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to
                        attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating
                        something of her that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and
                        found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,

                        should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a shame, especially
                        considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely
                        thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was

                        saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he
                        is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in
                        the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging
                        occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the

                        Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would
                        have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look
                        upon that as a mere excuse.&#8212;In the summer it might have passed; but
                        what can any body's native air do for them in the months of January,
                        February, and March? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the
                        purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do not
                        require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a
                        profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."</said></p>

                        moment. And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much
                        more durable&#8212; — indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us
                        were comfortable again&#8212; — yet that was too general a sensation for any
                        thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however,
                        that you might not have made discoveries."</said></p>

                        orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely covered, when
                        every corner dish was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were
                        generally restored, Emma said,</said></p>

                        tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a
                        present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."</said></p>

                        would have been guessed at first. She would not have been puzzled, had she
                        dared fix on them. I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly
                        convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."</said></p>

                        suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them
                        entirely. At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was
                        the giver, I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most
                        natural thing in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how
                        much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.
                        And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of

                        the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and
                        were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever

                        neither the one nor the other&#8212; nothing worse than everyday remarks,

                        singing. She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her

                        hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and
                        they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of
                        asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any
                        doubt before&#8212; — I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked
                        apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit
                        thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty
                        makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I

                        and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition. What was to be done?
                        This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were
                        conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too
                        small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much better size might be

                        long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a
                        difficulty. Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that
                        passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of

                        fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the

                        sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength. It was a long,
                        well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his
                        feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was
                        natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that
                        could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious
                        flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling
                        towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the
                        contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life
                        was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more

                        it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's
                        arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of
                        Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now
                        upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the
                        most irresistible form.&#8212;His wedding-day was named. He would soon be
                        among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk
                        over the first letter from Enscombe before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was in
                        every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the
                        sound. She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and
                        Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining
                        strength. With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great
                        deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she
                        had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual

                        for her, that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;
                        but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any
                        effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the
                        same. Harriet listened submissively, and said</said>

                            holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of <hi

                        wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath life, I have seen such instances
                        of it! And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use
                        to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much

                        the young are pretty generally understood. It would be a charming
                        introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could
                        immediately secure you some of the best society in the place. A line from me
                        would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend,
                        Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be
                        most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you

                        I assure you. Consider from how partial a quarter your information came. I

                        say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my

                        You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I assure you it has
                        been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a
                        musical society I am got into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a
                        necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical
                        society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious
                        sacrifice. I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my
                        future home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be
                        disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too&#8212; knowing what I had
                        been accustomed to&#8212;of course he was not wholly without apprehension.
                        When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">world</hi> I could give up&#8212; parties, balls, plays
                        &#8212;for I had no fear of retirement. Blessed with so many resources
                        within myself, the world was not necessary to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I
                        could do very well without it. To those who had no resources it was a
                        different thing; but my resources made me quite independent. And as to
                        smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I really could not give it a
                        thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.
                        Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did
                        assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were
                        spacious apartments. 'But,' said I, 'to be quite honest, I do not think I
                        can live without something of a musical society. I condition for nothing
                        else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.'"</said></p>

                        very timid and silent. One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.
                        I like her the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I
                        am a great advocate for timidity&#8212;and I am sure one does not often meet
                        with it.&#8212;But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely

                        extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could
                        make me regret having asked <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than Jane Fairfax to
                        partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I

                        greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in
                        doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably
                        be my model more than it ought to be&#8212;for we do not at all affect to
                        equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.&#8212;However, my resolution is
                        taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.&#8212;I shall certainly have her very
                        often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall have musical
                        parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an
                        eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little
                        doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly.&#8212;I shall introduce
                        her, of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to
                        us. I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets a little
                        acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off, for there really
                        is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating.&#8212;I
                        shall have her very often indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we
                        shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our

                        surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with
                        her. Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more readily
                        enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can
                        believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no

                        or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of
                        good-breeding. I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting
                        her visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will
                        not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring
                        her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring

                        ever was before, and she begins to want change. It is a retired place. A

                            injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it
                            difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You
                            cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of
                            the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame
                            of it is to be laid to her. She was the instigator. Frank's mother would
                            never have been slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has
                            pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet, indolent,
                            gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make
                            himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and
                            insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence
                            of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the
                            daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a
                            Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims:
                            but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart."</said></seg></p>

                        given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in
                        that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from
                        the airs they give themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me
                        think of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled
                        there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves
                        immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established
                        families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at
                        West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from
                        Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One
                        has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something direful
                        in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a
                        good many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they
                        evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who
                        happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr.
                        Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose
                        father had it before him &#8212;I believe, at least &#8212;I am almost sure

                        for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for

                        the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of
                        sentiment which he had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a
                        separation of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and
                        evils before her:&#8212;caution for him and for herself would be necessary.

                        rather anticipating something decisive. She felt as if the spring would not

                        composed and tranquil state.</said></p>

                        forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were
                        not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very
                        soon afterwards. He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do
                        more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then
                        exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was
                        influenced, and how she must act. They met with the utmost friendliness.
                        There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an
                        almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling
                        the same tenderness in the same degree. She watched him well.</said>

                        clear thing he was less in love than he had been. Absence, with the

                        not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference. He was not
                        calm; his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about
                        him. Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;
                        but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter
                        of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.</said>

                        inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a discreet
                        resolution of not trusting himself with her long.</said></p>

                        to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was really ill was

                        weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago. He did not believe
                        it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at
                        least that she might not have many years of existence before her;</said>

                        hour's ride. He would be always coming over. The difference in that respect
                        of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him
                        always and seeing him never. Sixteen miles&#8212; — nay, eighteen —
                        &#8212;it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street &#8212;was a serious

                        and returning. There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as
                        well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy

                        turning her head a little she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set,
                        the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her
                        eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a
                        dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she
                        perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not
                        only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant

                        on!&#8212;so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!&#8212;Yes, my dear, I ran
                        home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and
                        nobody missed me.&#8212;I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.
                        Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast
                        deal of chat, and backgammon.&#8212;Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and
                        baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her
                        throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and
                        who were your partners. 'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane; I left
                        her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it
                        herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will
                        ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too
                        obliging.&#8212;Is there nobody you would not rather?&#8212;I am not
                        helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on
                        the other!&#8212;Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is
                        going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!&#8212;Beautiful
                        lace!&#8212;Now we all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the
                        evening!&#8212;Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care
                        of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were
                        two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I
                        never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style&#8212; Candles
                        everywhere.&#8212;I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane &#8212;There was
                        a little disappointment.&#8212;The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in
                        their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and
                        some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the
                        asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing
                        grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus&#8212;so she was rather
                        disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear
                        of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much
                        concerned!&#8212;Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have
                        supposed any thing!&#8212;Such elegance and profusion!&#8212;I have seen
                        nothing like it since&#8212; Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?
                        Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                        sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side?&#8212;Well, I am
                        sure, Mr. Churchill&#8212; only it seems too good &#8212;but just as you
                        please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall
                        we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I
                        should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot

                        which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into
                        alarm.&#8212;About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and
                        deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch
                        very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they
                        had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch
                        of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came
                        towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a
                        great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank,
                        cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short
                        cut back to Highbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered
                        very much from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank
                        brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless&#8212; and

                        assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy,
                        all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in

                            spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles
                            knew of it as well as ourselves&#8212;but it was quite a secret, known
                            to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was
                            very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in
                            great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane,
                            don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I
                            forget where we had been walking to&#8212; very likely to Randalls; yes,
                            I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of
                            my mother &#8212;indeed I do not know who is not &#8212;and she had
                            mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling
                            us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this,
                            I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will
                            not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I
                            do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know;
                            I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me
                            which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for

                        a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">They had a very fine day for
                        Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement,
                        accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. Mr.
                        Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the
                        Vicarage, and every body was in good time. Emma and Harriet went together;
                        Miss Bates and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs.
                        Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when
                        they got there. Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and
                        every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general
                        amount of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of
                        spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too
                        much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of
                        Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And
                        Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first
                        an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton,
                        indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could;
                        but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a
                        principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine
                        prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to
                        remove.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">At first it was downright
                        dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid. He
                        said nothing worth hearing &#8212;looked without seeing &#8212;admired
                        without intelligence&#8212; listened without knowing what she said.</said>
                    <said direct="false" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar_emma">

                        so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and they
                        were both insufferable.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">When they all sat down it was
                        better; to her taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative
                        and gay, making her his first object. Every distinguishing attention that
                        could be paid, was paid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes,
                        seemed all that he cared for&#8212;and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry
                        to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly
                        encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the
                        first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her
                        own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking
                        on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation
                        could very well describe. "Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted
                        together excessively." They were laying themselves open to that very
                        phrase&#8212;and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one
                        lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any
                        real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had
                        expected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him
                        for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration,
                        or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart.
                        She still intended him for her friend.</said></p>

                        Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself

                        give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of
                        collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have

                        father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what
                        John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise
                        having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That

                        check,&#8212;interested, without disturbing him. He had long made up his
                        mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it
                        cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected
                        blow.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">The following day brought
                        news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background. An express
                        arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her
                        nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account, she had
                        not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a
                        different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state, had carried
                        her off after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no
                    more.</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.005.nar">It was felt as such things
                        must be felt. Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness
                        towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a
                        reasonable time, curiosity to know where she would be buried. Goldsmith
                        tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but
                        to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be
                        recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked
                        at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances.
                        In one point she was fully justified. She had never been admitted before to
                        be seriously ill. The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all
                        the selfishness of imaginary complaints.</said></p>

                        attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill,
                        independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be
                        persuaded into any thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was,
                        that the nephew should form the attachment,</said>

                        brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a
                        proof in her of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that
                        might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's

                        Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the

                        friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last

                        proposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged
                        &#8212;appetite quite gone&#8212; and though there were no absolutely
                        alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the

                        so herself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her
                        present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous
                        disorder:&#8212;confined always to one room;&#8212;he could have wished it

                        Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too
                        great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good

                        wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His
                        companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth

                        become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best

                        threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her happiness
                        depended on being <hi rend="italic">first</hi> with Mr. Knightley, first in

                        supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.&#8212;</said>

                        long, she felt she had been first; for, having no female connexions of his
                        own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers,
                        and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella. She
                        had herself been first with him for many years past. She had not deserved
                        it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even
                        wilfully opposing him, insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with
                        him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her
                        own&#8212;but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough
                        excellence of mind, he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with
                        an endeavour to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no
                        other creature had at all shared.</said>

                        write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a

                        confusion of the lady. She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every
                        look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.
                        The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous
                        delight of her daughter&#8212;who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,
                        had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so
                        truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;
                        thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves,
                        that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent
                        illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing;
                        she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded;
                        and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,
                        overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the
                        important subject. Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their
                        first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always
                        feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but
                        when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present
                        and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that
                        such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up
                        within her own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much
                        pleased with all that she had said on the subject.</said></p>

                        the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same
                        melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield&#8212;but in the afternoon it
                        cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried
                        off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all the eagerness which
                        such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as
                        possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature,
                        tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her.
                        She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr.
                        Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her
                        father, she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.&#8212;There, with
                        spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few
                        turns, when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and
                        coming towards her.&#8212;It was the first intimation of his being returned
                        from London. She had been thinking of him the moment before, as
                        unquestionably sixteen miles distant.&#8212;There was time only for the
                        quickest arrangement of mind. She must be collected and calm. In half a
                        minute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet and constrained on

                        Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably
                        enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that
                        had taken him from the country.&#8212;The Box Hill party had decided him on
                        going away. He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,

                        indifferent.&#8212;But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much
                        domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in
                        it; Isabella was too much like Emma&#8212; differing only in those striking

                        much to have been done, even had his time been longer.&#8212;He had stayed
                        on, however, vigorously, day after day&#8212; till this very morning's post
                        had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.&#8212;Then, with the gladness
                        which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never
                        believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond
                        solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no longer. He
                        had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner,
                        to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of

                        <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.005.frank">"If I made myself
                                intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected; but expected
                                or not, I know it will be read with candour and
                                indulgence.&#8212;You are all goodness, and I believe there will be
                                need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past
                                conduct.&#8212;But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to
                                resent. My courage rises while I write. It is very difficult for the
                                prosperous to be humble. I have already met with such success in two
                                applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself
                                too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have had any
                                ground of offence.&#8212;You must all endeavour to comprehend the
                                exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; you
                                must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all
                                hazards. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation
                                requiring such concealment, is another question. I shall not discuss
                                it here. For my temptation to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it a
                                right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows
                                below, and casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her
                                openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too
                                well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to
                                prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most
                                upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret
                                engagement.&#8212;Had she refused, I should have gone mad.&#8212;But
                                you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing
                                this?&#8212;What did you look forward to?&#8212;To any thing, every
                                thing&#8212; to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden
                                bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every
                                possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings
                                secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence. If
                                you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of
                                being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a
                                disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses or
                                lands can ever equal the value of.&#8212;See me, then, under these
                                circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;&#8212;and
                                here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner
                                paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss
                                Fairfax was in Highbury; and as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were the
                                person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on
                                my father's compassion, by reminding him, that so long as I absented
                                myself from his house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.
                                My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with
                                you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one
                                point. And now I come to the principal, the only important part of
                                my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or
                                requires very solicitous explanation. With the greatest respect, and
                                the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father
                                perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest
                                humiliation.&#8212;A few words which dropped from him yesterday
                                spoke his opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable
                                to.&#8212;My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more
                                than it ought.&#8212;In order to assist a concealment so essential
                                to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort
                                of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.&#8212;I cannot
                                deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object&#8212;but I am
                                sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced
                                of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish
                                views to go on.&#8212;Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,
                                she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached;
                                and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached
                                to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.&#8212;She received my
                                attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which
                                exactly suited me. We seemed to understand each other. From our
                                relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to
                                be so.&#8212;Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me
                                before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;&#8212;when I
                                called to take leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment
                                of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not without
                                suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me, at
                                least in some degree.&#8212;She may not have surmised the whole, but
                                her quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You
                                will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present
                                restraints, that it did not take her wholly by surprize. She
                                frequently gave me hints of it. I remember</said>

                                owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss

                            <said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.005.frank">I hope this history
                                of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as
                                great extenuation of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as
                                having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from
                                either. Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable,
                                the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I
                                regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her as
                                deeply and as happily in love as myself.&#8212;Whatever strange
                                things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.
                                My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither
                                as often as might be, and with the least suspicion. If you remember
                                any queernesses, set them all to the right account.&#8212;Of the
                                pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that
                                its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F&#8212;, who would
                                never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given
                                her.&#8212;The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,
                                my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will
                                soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.&#8212;No
                                description can describe her. She must tell you herself what she
                                is&#8212; — yet not by word, for never was there a human creature
                                who would so designedly suppress her own merit.&#8212;Since I began
                                this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from
                                her.&#8212;She gives a good account of her own health; but as she
                                never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion of
                                her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread
                                of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you
                                without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember
                                how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a
                                state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from
                                happiness or misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have
                                met with, of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity,
                                I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I
                                occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad
                                with anger. If I could but see her again!&#8212;But I must not
                                propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to
                                encroach.&#8212;I must still add to this long letter. You have not
                                heard all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected
                                detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the
                                unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation;
                                for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude,
                                immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have
                                presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular
                                circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose. I should myself
                                have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have felt every
                                scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.&#8212;But I
                                had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered into with that
                                woman&#8212; Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off
                                abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.&#8212;I have been walking
                                over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the
                                rest of my letter what it ought to be.&#8212;It is, in fact, a most
                                mortifying retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can
                                admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F.,
                                were highly blameable. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> disapproved them,
                                which ought to have been enough.&#8212;My plea of concealing the
                                truth she did not think sufficient.&#8212;She was displeased; I
                                thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand occasions,
                                unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even cold. But
                                she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my
                                spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have
                                escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.&#8212;We
                                quarrelled.&#8212; Do you remember the morning spent at
                                    Donwell?&#8212;<hi rend="italic">There</hi> every little
                                dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was
                                late; I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with
                                her, but she would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow
                                me, which I then thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see
                                nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of
                                discretion. While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was
                                behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman,
                                was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have
                                made every previous caution useless?&#8212;Had we been met walking
                                together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been
                                suspected.&#8212;I was mad enough, however, to resent.&#8212;I
                                doubted her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill;
                                when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent
                                neglect of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would
                                have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her
                                resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.&#8212;In
                                short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,
                                abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,
                                though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely
                                because I would be as angry with her as possible. Even then, I was
                                not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was
                                the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went away
                                determined that she should make the first advances.&#8212;I shall
                                always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.
                                Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would
                                ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon her appears in
                                the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she found I was
                                really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that
                                officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by
                                the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not
                                quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly
                                extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest
                                against the share of it which that woman has known.&#8212;</said>

                                hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of
                                needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.

                                this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next

                                business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent

                            arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly
                            natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that
                            business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different

                            were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her
                            fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley
                            were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they

                            I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle seems always tired

                            and then at Randalls.&#8212;But how to break it to her father at
                            last!&#8212;She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.

                            failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come
                            at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.&#8212;She
                            was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a
                            more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She
                            must not appear to think it a misfortune.&#8212;With all the spirits she
                            could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,
                            in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be
                            obtained&#8212; which, she trusted, would be attended with no
                            difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all&#8212;
                            she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would
                            receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she knew he
                            loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the

                            would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for
                            her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss
                            Taylor.&#8212;But it would not do. Emma hung about him affectionately,
                            and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with
                            Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield,
                            had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from

                            their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very
                            sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley

                            Knightley?&#8212;Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his

                            so attached to him?&#8212;Would not he like to have him always on the
                            spot?&#8212;Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be
                            there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;&#8212;but they
                            did see him every day as it was.&#8212;Why could not they go on as they

                            which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or

                            utmost.&#8212;She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he
                            deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper,
                            suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point

                            herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the
                            stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long
                            ago.&#8212;How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma
                            would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.

                            and Hartfield had been a continual impediment — &#8212;less acknowledged
                            by Mr. Weston than by herself&#8212; — but even he had never been able

                            did &#8212;and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an

                            morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first on
                            my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of the
