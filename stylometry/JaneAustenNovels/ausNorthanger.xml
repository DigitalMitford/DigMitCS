                <head>Advertisement by the Authoress, to Northanger Abbey</head>


                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">THIS little work was finished
                        in the year 1803, and intended for immediate publication. It was disposed of
                        to a bookseller, it was even advertised, and why the business proceeded no
                        farther, the author has never been able to learn. That any bookseller should
                        think it worth-while to purchase what he did not think it worth-while to
                        publish seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the
                        public have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon
                        those parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively
                        obsolete. The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have
                        passed since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during
                        that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone
                        considerable changes.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">No one who had ever seen
                        Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an
                        heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother, her
                        own person and disposition, were all equally against her. Her father was a
                        clergyman, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man,
                        though his name was Richard &#8212; and he had never been handsome. He had a
                        considerable independence besides two good livings &#8212; and he was not in
                        the least addicted to locking up his daughters. Her mother was a woman of
                        useful plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a
                        good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine was born; and instead
                        of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might expect, she
                        still lived on &#8212; lived to have six children more &#8212; to see them
                        growing up around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family of
                        ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are heads and
                        arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had little other right
                        to the word, for they were in general very plain, and Catherine, for many
                        years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin awkward figure, a sallow
                        skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features &#8212; so much for
                        her person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind. She was
                        fond of all boy’s plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls,
                        but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a
                        canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden;
                        and if she gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of
                        mischief &#8212; at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring
                        those which she was forbidden to take. Such were her propensities &#8212;
                        her abilities were quite as extraordinary. She never could learn or
                        understand anything before she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for
                        she was often inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her mother was three
                        months in teaching her only to repeat the “Beggar’s Petition”; and after
                        all, her next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that
                        Catherine was always stupid &#8212; by no means; she learnt the fable of
                        “The Hare and Many Friends” as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother
                        wished her to learn music; and</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">for she was very fond of
                        tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight years old she
                        began.</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">and Mrs. Morland, who did
                        not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or
                        distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which dismissed the music-master
                        was one of the happiest of Catherine’s life. Her taste for drawing was not
                        superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her
                        mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in
                        that way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like
                        one another. Writing and accounts she was taught by her father; French by
                        her mother: her proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she shirked
                        her lessons in both whenever she could. What a strange, unaccountable
                        character! &#8212; for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years
                        old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn,
                        scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few
                        interruptions of tyranny; she was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement
                        and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the
                        green slope at the back of the house.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Such was Catherine Morland at
                        ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending; she began to curl her hair and
                        long for balls; her complexion improved, her features were softened by
                        plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more animation, and her figure more
                        consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she
                        grew clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing
                        her father and mother remark on her personal improvement.</said>
                    <said who="aus.003.mrsm_mrm" direct="true" aloud="true">“Catherine grows quite a
                        good-looking girl &#8212; she is almost pretty today,”</said>
                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">were words which caught her
                        ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is
                        an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the
                        first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever
                        receive.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Mrs. Morland was a very good
                        woman, and wished to see her children everything they ought to be; but her
                        time was so much occupied in lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her
                        elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not
                        very wonderful that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her,
                        should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the
                        country at the age of fourteen, to books &#8212; or at least books of
                        information &#8212; for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could
                        be gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she had
                        never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen she was
                        in training for a heroine; she read all such works as heroines must read to
                        supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so
                        soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.</said></p>

                <p>From Pope, she learnt to censure those who</p>

                        <l>“bear about the mockery of woe.”</l>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">So far her improvement was
                        sufficient &#8212; and in many other points she came on exceedingly well;
                        for though she could not write sonnets, she brought herself to read them;
                        and though there seemed no chance of her throwing a whole party into
                        raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her own composition, she could
                        listen to other people’s performance with very little fatigue. Her greatest
                        deficiency was in the pencil &#8212; she had no notion of drawing &#8212;
                        not enough even to attempt a sketch of her lover’s profile, that she might
                        be detected in the design. There she fell miserably short of the true heroic
                        height. At present she did not know her own poverty, for she had no lover to
                        portray. She had reached the age of seventeen, without having seen one
                        amiable youth who could call forth her sensibility, without having inspired
                        one real passion, and without having excited even any admiration but what
                        was very moderate and very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange
                        things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out.
                        There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no &#8212; not even a baronet.
                        There was not one family among their acquaintance who had reared and
                        supported a boy accidentally found at their door &#8212; not one young man
                        whose origin was unknown. Her father had no ward, and the squire of the
                        parish no children.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">But when a young lady is to
                        be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent

                        drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs. Morland will be naturally supposed
                        to be most severe. A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved
                        Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness,
                        and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and
                        advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from
                        her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet. Cautions against
                        the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young
                        ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve the
                        fulness of her heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew so
                        little of lords and baronets, that she entertained no notion of their
                        general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her
                        daughter from their machinations. Her cautions were confined to the
                        following points.</said>
                    <said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.mrsm">“I beg, Catherine, you will
                        always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat, when you come from the
                        rooms at night; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money
                        you spend; I will give you this little book on purpose.”</said></p>

                        altering her name as far as she can?), must from situation be at this time
                        the intimate friend and confidante of her sister. It is remarkable, however,
                        that she neither insisted on Catherine’s writing by every post, nor exacted
                        her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a
                        detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything
                        indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the
                        Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather
                        consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the refined
                        susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation of a
                        heroine from her family ought always to excite. Her father, instead of
                        giving her an unlimited order on his banker, or even putting an hundred
                        pounds bank-bill into her hands, gave her only ten guineas, and promised her
                        more when she wanted it.</said></p>

                        with suitable quietness and uneventful safety. Neither robbers nor tempests
                        befriended them, nor one lucky overturn to introduce them to the hero.
                        Nothing more alarming occurred than a fear, on Mrs. Allen’s side, of having
                        once left her clogs behind her at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be
                        groundless.</said></p>

                        Catherine was all eager delight &#8212; her eyes were here, there,
                        everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking environs, and
                        afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel.

                        some description of Mrs. Allen, that the reader may be able to judge in what
                        manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of
                        the work, and how she will, probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to
                        all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable &#8212;
                        whether by her imprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy &#8212; whether by
                        intercepting her letters, ruining her character, or turning her out of
                        doors.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Mrs. Allen was one of that
                        numerous class of females, whose society can raise no other emotion than
                        surprise at there being any men in the world who could like them well enough
                        to marry them. She had neither beauty, genius, accomplishment, nor manner.
                        The air of a gentlewoman, a great deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a
                        trifling turn of mind were all that could account for her being the choice
                        of a sensible, intelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she was
                        admirably fitted to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of
                        going everywhere and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be.
                        Dress was her passion. She had a most harmless delight in being fine; and
                        our heroine’s entree into life could not take place till after three or four
                        days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her chaperone was
                        provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too made some
                        purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the important
                        evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms. Her hair was cut
                        and dressed by the best hand, her clothes put on with care, and both</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">With such encouragement,
                        Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd. As for
                        admiration, it was always very welcome when it came, but she did not depend
                        on it.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Mrs. Allen was so long in
                        dressing that they did not enter the ballroom till late. The season was
                        full, the room crowded, and the two ladies squeezed in as well as they
                        could. As for Mr. Allen, he repaired directly to the card-room, and left
                        them to enjoy a mob by themselves. With more care for the safety of her new
                        gown than for the comfort of her protegee, Mrs. Allen made her way through
                        the throng of men by the door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would
                        allow; Catherine, however, kept close at her side, and linked her arm too
                        firmly within her friend’s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a
                        struggling assembly. But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed
                        along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the
                        crowd; it seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she had
                        imagined that when once fairly within the door, they should easily find
                        seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was
                        far from being the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even
                        the top of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing of
                        the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still they moved on
                        &#8212; something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion of
                        strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage behind
                        the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd than below; and
                        hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the company beneath her,
                        and of all the dangers of her late passage through them. It was a splendid
                        sight, and she began, for the first time that evening, to feel herself at a
                        ball: she longed to dance, but she had not an acquaintance in the room. Mrs.
                        Allen did all that she could do in such a case by saying very placidly,
                        every now and then,</said>
                    <said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.mrsa">“I wish you could dance, my

                        friend felt obliged to her for these wishes; but they were repeated so
                        often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine grew tired at last,
                        and would thank her no more.</said></p>

                        however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence they had so laboriously gained.

                        rest. Catherine began to feel something of disappointment &#8212; she was
                        tired of being continually pressed against by people, the generality of
                        whose faces possessed nothing to interest, and with all of whom she was so
                        wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of
                        imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives;
                        and when at last arrived in the tea-room, she felt yet more the awkwardness
                        of having no party to join, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist
                        them. They saw nothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain
                        for a more eligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a
                        table, at which a large party were already placed, without having anything

                        pleasure, and answered with all the pretty expressions she could command;
                        and, as the first proof of amity, she was soon invited to accept an arm of
                        the eldest Miss Thorpe, and take a turn with her about the room. Catherine
                        was delighted with this extension of her Bath acquaintance, and almost
                        forgot Mr. Tilney while she talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly
                        the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Their conversation turned
                        upon those subjects, of which the free discussion has generally much to do
                        in perfecting a sudden intimacy between two young ladies: such as dress,
                        balls, flirtations, and quizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years
                        older than Miss Morland, and at least four years better informed, had a very
                        decided advantage in discussing such points; she could compare the balls of
                        Bath with those of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London;
                        could rectify the opinions of her new friend in many articles of tasteful
                        attire; could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only
                        smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a crowd.
                        These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they were
                        entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might have been
                        too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss Thorpe’s manners,
                        and her frequent expressions of delight on this acquaintance with her,
                        softened down every feeling of awe, and left nothing but tender affection.
                        Their increasing attachment was not to be satisfied with half a dozen turns
                        in the pump-room, but required, when they all quitted it together, that Miss
                        Thorpe should accompany Miss Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen’s house;
                        and that they should there part with a most affectionate and lengthened
                        shake of hands, after learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see
                        each other across the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same
                        chapel the next morning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched
                        Miss Thorpe’s progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired
                        the graceful spirit of her walk, the fashionable air of her figure and
                        dress; and felt grateful, as well she might, for the chance which had
                        procured her such a friend.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and
                        not a very rich one; she was a good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very
                        indulgent mother. Her eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the
                        younger ones, by pretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her
                        air, and dressing in the same style, did very well.</said></p>

                        otherwise be expected to occupy the three or four following chapters; in

                        engaged at the theatre that evening, in returning the nods and smiles of
                        Miss Thorpe, though they certainly claimed much of her leisure, as to forget
                        to look with an inquiring eye for Mr. Tilney in every box which her eye
                        could reach; but she looked in vain. Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play
                        than the pump-room. She hoped to be more fortunate the next day; and when
                        her wishes for fine weather were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she
                        hardly felt a doubt of it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of
                        its inhabitants, and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about
                        and tell their acquaintance what a charming day it is.</said></p>

                        over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly joined each other; and after staying
                        long enough in the pump-room to discover that the crowd was insupportable,
                        and that there was not a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers
                        every Sunday throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to
                        breathe the fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm in
                        arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation;
                        they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again was Catherine
                        disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner. He was nowhere to be met
                        with; every search for him was equally unsuccessful, in morning lounges or
                        evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower Rooms, at dressed or
                        undressed balls, was he perceivable; nor among the walkers, the horsemen, or
                        the curricle-drivers of the morning. His name was not in the pump-room book,
                        and curiosity could do no more.</said>

                        imagination around his person and manners, and increased her anxiety to know
                        more of him. From the Thorpes she could learn nothing, for they had been
                        only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject,
                        however, in which she often indulged with her fair friend, from whom she
                        received every possible encouragement to continue to think of him; and his
                        impression on her fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken.</said>

                        know when delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence

                            spent the chief of it by the side of Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called
                            conversation, but in which there was scarcely ever any exchange of
                            opinion, and not often any resemblance of subject, for Mrs. Thorpe
                            talked chiefly of her children, and Mrs. Allen of her
                        gowns.</said></seg></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">The progress of the
                        friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had
                        been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing
                        tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their
                        friends or themselves. They called each other by their Christian name, were
                        always arm in arm when they walked, pinned up each other’s train for the
                        dance, and were not to be divided in the set; and if a rainy morning
                        deprived them of other enjoyments, they were still resolute in meeting in
                        defiance of wet and dirt, and shut themselves up, to read novels together.
                        Yes, novels; for I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so
                        common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the
                        very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding &#8212;
                        joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on
                        such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own
                        heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its
                        insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not
                        patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection
                        and regard? I cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to
                        abuse such effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to
                        talk in threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let
                        us not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions
                        have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any other
                        literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has been so
                        much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes are almost as many
                        as our readers. And while the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of
                        the History of England, or of the man who collects and publishes in a volume
                        some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the
                        Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne, are eulogized by a thousand pens
                        &#8212; there seems almost a general wish of decrying the capacity and
                        undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting the performances
                        which have only genius, wit, and taste to recommend them.</said>

                            what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at least
                            this age!”</said></seg></p>

                        sorry for it; but really I thought I was in very good time. It is but just
                        one. I hope you have not been here long?”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.isa">“Oh! These ten ages at least.
                        I am sure I have been here this half hour. But now, let us go and sit down
                        at the other end of the room, and enjoy ourselves. I have an hundred things
                        to say to you. In the first place, I was so afraid it would rain this
                        morning, just as I wanted to set off; it looked very showery, and that would
                        have thrown me into agonies! Do you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can
                        imagine, in a shop window in Milsom Street just now &#8212; very like yours,
                        only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green; I quite longed for it. But,
                        my dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with yourself all this
                        morning? Have you gone on with Udolpho?”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.cat">“Yes, I have been reading it
                        ever since I woke; and I am got to the black veil.”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.isa">“Are you, indeed? How
                        delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the
                        world! Are not you wild to know?”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.cat">“Oh! Yes, quite; what can it
                        be? But do not tell me &#8212; I would not be told upon any account. I know
                        it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is Laurentina’s skeleton. Oh! I am
                        delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it.
                        I assure you, if it had not been to meet you, I would not have come away
                        from it for all the world.”</said></p>

                        obliged to you; and when you have finished Udolpho, we will read the Italian
                        together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind
                        for you.”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.cat">“Have you, indeed! How glad I

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.isa">“I will read you their names
                        directly; here they are, in my pocketbook. Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont,
                        Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan
                        of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries. Those will last us some

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.isa">“Yes, quite sure; for a
                        particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest
                        creatures in the world, has read every one of them. I wish you knew Miss
                        Andrews, you would be delighted with her. She is netting herself the
                        sweetest cloak you can conceive. I think her as beautiful as an angel, and I
                        am so vexed with the men for not admiring her! I scold them all amazingly
                        about it.”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.cat">“Scold them! Do you scold them
                        for not admiring her?”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.isa">“Yes, that I do. There is
                        nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion
                        of loving people by halves; it is not my nature. My attachments are always
                        excessively strong. I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter
                        that if he was to tease me all night, I would not dance with him, unless he
                        would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us
                        incapable of real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the
                        difference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I
                        should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are just
                        the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.”</said></p>

                            for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her. Oh! I
                            must tell you, that just after we parted yesterday, I saw a young man
                            looking at you so earnestly &#8212; I am sure he is in love with
                            you.”</said>

                            cannot blame you” &#8212;</said>

                            little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else. Everything
                            is so insipid, so uninteresting, that does not relate to the beloved

                        being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs.
                        Allen, between whom she now remained. She could not help being vexed at the
                        non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she not only longed to be dancing, but was
                        likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her situation could not be
                        known, she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting
                        down all the discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of
                        the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity,
                        her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of
                        her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the
                        heroine’s life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her
                        character. Catherine had fortitude too; she suffered, but no murmur passed
                        her lips.</said></p>

                        humiliation, she was roused, at the end of ten minutes, to a pleasanter
                        feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr. Tilney, within three yards of
                        the place where they sat; he seemed to be moving that way, but he did not
                        see her, and therefore the smile and the blush, which his sudden
                        reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away without sullying her heroic
                        importance. He looked as handsome and as lively as ever, and was talking
                        with interest to a fashionable and pleasing-looking young woman, who leant
                        on his arm, and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister; thus
                        unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her
                        forever, by being married already. But guided only by what was simple and
                        probable, it had never entered her head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he
                        had not behaved, he had not talked, like the married men to whom she had
                        been used; he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.
                        From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister’s now
                        being by his side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike paleness
                        and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen’s bosom, Catherine sat erect, in the
                        perfect use of her senses, and with cheeks only a little redder than
                        usual.</said></p>

                        consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. This compliment,
                        delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the lady; and in
                        giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as

                        half a minute earlier, he might have thought her sufferings rather too
                        acute. The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her
                        waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the
                        particulars which he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses
                        and dogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of
                        terriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking very
                        often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her
                        dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman,
                        she could see nothing. They were in different sets. She was separated from
                        all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; one mortification
                        succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that
                        to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the
                        dignity or enjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this,
                        she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round,
                        perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a

                        Thorpe’s, had more real elegance. Her manners showed good sense and good
                        breeding; they were neither shy nor affectedly open; and she seemed capable
                        of being young, attractive, and at a ball without wanting to fix the
                        attention of every man near her, and without exaggerated feelings of
                        ecstatic delight or inconceivable vexation on every little trifling
                        occurrence. Catherine, interested at once by her appearance and her
                        relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous of being acquainted with her, and
                        readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say, and
                        had courage and leisure for saying it. But the hindrance thrown in the way
                        of a very speedy intimacy, by the frequent want of one or more of these
                        requisites, prevented their doing more than going through the first

                        unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows. It appeared first
                        in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her, while she remained in
                        the rooms, which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent
                        desire to go home. This, on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction
                        of extraordinary hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest
                        longing to be in bed; such was the extreme point of her distress; for when
                        there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and
                        from which she awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh
                        hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her heart was to improve her
                        acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her first resolution, to seek her
                        for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one so newly
                        arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she had already found so
                        favourable for the discovery of female excellence, and the completion of
                        female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited
                        confidence, that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend
                        from within its walls. Her plan for the morning thus settled, she sat
                        quietly down to her book after breakfast,</said>

                        propensities of a rattle, nor to know to how many idle assertions and
                        impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead. Her own family were
                        plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind; her
                        father, at the utmost, being contented with a pun, and her mother with a
                        proverb; they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase
                        their importance, or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict
                        the next. She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity, and
                        was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer
                        insight into his real opinion on the subject; but she checked herself,
                        because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer
                        insights, in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous;
                        and, joining to this, the consideration that he would not really suffer his
                        sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily

                        in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister. Could she have
                        foreseen such a circumstance, nothing should have persuaded her to go out
                        with the others; and, as it was, she could only lament her ill luck, and
                        think over what she had lost, till it was clear to her that the drive had by
                        no means been very pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite

                        that, though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks, we would not live

                        exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in

                        endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next
                        morning; and till the usual moment of going to the pump-room, she felt some
                        alarm from the dread of a second prevention. But nothing of that kind
                        occurred, no visitors appeared to delay them, and they all three set off in
                        good time for the pump-room, where the ordinary course of events and
                        conversation took place; Mr. Allen, after drinking his glass of water,
                        joined some gentlemen to talk over the politics of the day and compare the
                        accounts of their newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing
                        every new face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of
                        the Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in
                        less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her usual
                        place by the side of her friend. James, who was now in constant attendance,
                        maintained a similar position, and separating themselves from the rest of
                        their party, they walked in that manner for some time, till Catherine began
                        to doubt the happiness of a situation which, confining her entirely to her
                        friend and brother, gave her very little share in the notice of either. They
                        were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but
                        their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity
                        attended with so much laughter, that though Catherine’s supporting opinion
                        was not unfrequently called for by one or the other, she was never able to
                        give any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however she
                        was empowered to disengage herself from her friend, by the avowed necessity
                        of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she most joyfully saw just entering the
                        room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she instantly joined, with a firmer
                        determination to be acquainted, than she might have had courage to command,
                        had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before. Miss Tilney
                        met her with great civility, returned her advances with equal goodwill, and
                        they continued talking together as long as both parties remained in the
                        room; and though in all probability not an observation was made, nor an
                        expression used by either which had not been made and used some thousands of
                        times before, under that roof, in every Bath season, yet the merit of their
                        being spoken with simplicity and truth, and without personal conceit, might
                        be something uncommon.</said></p>

                        consciousness of having explained them.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">She went home very happy. The
                        morning had answered all her hopes, and the evening of the following day was
                        now the object of expectation, the future good. What gown and what
                        head-dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern. She
                        cannot be justified in it. Dress is at all times a frivolous distinction,
                        and excessive solicitude about it often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew
                        all this very well; her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject
                        only the Christmas before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday
                        night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin, and nothing but
                        the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening.
                        This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon, from
                        which one of the other sex rather than her own, a brother rather than a
                        great aunt, might have warned her, for man only can be aware of the
                        insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to the
                        feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the
                        heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire; how
                        little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of
                        peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the mull, or the
                        jackonet. Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire
                        her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion
                        are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will
                        be most endearing to the latter. But not one of these grave reflections
                        troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">She entered the rooms on
                        Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her
                        thither the Monday before. She had then been exulting in her engagement to
                        Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight, lest he should
                        engage her again; for though she could not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney
                        should ask her a third time to dance, her wishes, hopes, and plans all

                        same agitation. All have been, or at least all have believed themselves to
                        be, in danger from the pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all
                        have been anxious for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please.
                        As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine’s agony began; she
                        fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her, hid herself as much as
                        possible from his view, and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him.
                        The cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she saw nothing
                        of the Tilneys.</said></p>

                        of refusal; that in both, it is an engagement between man and woman, formed
                        for the advantage of each; and that when once entered into, they belong
                        exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is
                        their duty, each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he
                        or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep

                        the support of the woman, the woman to make the home agreeable to the man;
                        he is to purvey, and she is to smile. But in dancing, their duties are
                        exactly changed; the agreeableness, the compliance are expected from him,
                        while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water. That, I suppose, was the
                        difference of duties which struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable

                        listened reluctantly, and her replies were short. Blaize Castle remained her
                        only comfort; towards that, she still looked at intervals with pleasure;
                        though rather than be disappointed of the promised walk, and especially
                        rather than be thought ill of by the Tilneys, she would willingly have given
                        up all the happiness which its walls could supply &#8212; the happiness of a
                        progress through a long suite of lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of
                        magnificent furniture, though now for many years deserted &#8212; the
                        happiness of being stopped in their way along narrow, winding vaults, by a

                        extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and of being left in total darkness.
                        In the meanwhile, they proceeded on their journey without any mischance, and
                        were within view of the town of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who

                        mortification, left the house. She felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney
                        was at home, and too much offended to admit her; and as she retired down the
                        street, could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in
                        expectation of seeing her there, but no one appeared at them. At the bottom
                        of the street, however, she looked back again, and then, not at a window,
                        but issuing from the door, she saw Miss Tilney herself. She was followed by
                        a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her father, and they turned up
                        towards Edgar’s Buildings. Catherine, in deep mortification, proceeded on
                        her way. She could almost be angry herself at such angry incivility; but she
                        checked the resentful sensation; she remembered her own ignorance. She knew
                        not how such an offence as hers might be classed by the laws of worldly
                        politeness, to what a degree of unforgivingness it might with propriety
                        lead, nor to what rigours of rudeness in return it might justly make her
                        amenable.</said></p>

                        but it must be confessed that they were not of long continuance, for she
                        soon recollected, in the first place, that she was without any excuse for

                        to see. To the theatre accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to
                        plague or please her; she feared that, amongst the many perfections of the
                        family, a fondness for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was
                        because they were habituated to the finer performances of the London stage,
                        which she knew, on</said>

                        own expectation of pleasure; the comedy so well suspended her care that no
                        one, observing her during the first four acts, would have supposed she had
                        any wretchedness about her. On the beginning of the fifth, however, the
                        sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his father, joining a party in the
                        opposite box, recalled her to anxiety and distress. The stage could no
                        longer excite genuine merriment &#8212; no longer keep her whole attention.
                        Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and,
                        for the space of two entire scenes, did she thus watch Henry Tilney, without
                        being once able to catch his eye. No longer could he be suspected of
                        indifference for a play; his notice was never withdrawn from the stage
                        during two whole scenes. At length, however, he did look towards her, and he
                        bowed &#8212; but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attended it;
                        his eyes were immediately returned to their former direction. Catherine was
                        restlessly miserable; she could almost have run round to the box in which he
                        sat and forced him to hear her explanation. Feelings rather natural than
                        heroic possessed her; instead of considering her own dignity injured by this
                        ready condemnation &#8212; instead of proudly resolving, in conscious
                        innocence, to show her resentment towards him who could harbour a doubt of
                        it, to leave to him all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to
                        enlighten him on the past only by avoiding his sight, or flirting with
                        somebody else &#8212; she took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at
                        least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of explaining
                        its cause.</said></p>

                        round to their box. She was right; in a few minutes he appeared, and, making

                        Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now passed in review before the reader;
                        the events of each day, its hopes and fears, mortifications and pleasures,
                        have been separately stated, and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be
                        described, and close the week. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not
                        relinquished, and on the afternoon’s crescent of this day, it was brought
                        forward again. In a private consultation between Isabella and James, the
                        former of whom had particularly set her heart upon going, and the latter no

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="false" aloud="false">it was agreed that,</said>

                        weather were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and
                        they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time.</said>
                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">The affair thus determined,
                        and Thorpe’s approbation secured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of
                        it. She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney. In that
                        interval the plan was completed, and as soon as she came again, her
                        agreement was demanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by
                        Isabella,</said>

                        The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former

                        moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk tomorrow; it was
                        quite determined, and she would not, upon any account, retract.</said>

                        anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are stronger than
                        anybody’s; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace; and to see myself
                        supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick, I own.
                        These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.”</said></p>

                        her mind, though she said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied
                        her handkerchief to her eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight, could

                        &#8212; it is very tiresome: and yet I often think it odd that it should be
                        so dull, for a great deal of it must be invention. The speeches that are put
                        into the heroes’ mouths, their thoughts and designs &#8212; the chief of all
                        this must be invention, and invention is what delights me in other

                        would always wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she have the misfortune

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">A few days passed away, and
                        Catherine, though not allowing herself to suspect her friend, could not help
                        watching her closely. The result of her observations was not agreeable.
                        Isabella seemed an altered creature. When she saw her, indeed, surrounded
                        only by their immediate friends in Edgar’s Buildings or Pulteney Street, her
                        change of manners was so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might
                        have passed unnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that
                        boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would
                        occasionally come across her; but had nothing worse appeared, that might
                        only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when
                        Catherine saw her in public, admitting Captain Tilney’s attentions as
                        readily as they were offered, and allowing him almost an equal share with
                        James in her notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be
                        passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her friend
                        could be at, was beyond her comprehension.</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">but it was a degree of
                        wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was the
                        sufferer. She saw him grave and uneasy; and however careless of his present
                        comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart, to her it was always
                        an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she was greatly concerned. Though his
                        looks did not please her, his name was a passport to her goodwill, and she
                        thought with sincere compassion of his approaching disappointment; for, in
                        spite of what she had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room, his
                        behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella’s engagement that
                        she could not, upon reflection, imagine him aware of it.</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">She wished, by a gentle

                        this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or
                        comprehension was always against her. If able to suggest a hint, Isabella
                        could never understand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the
                        Tilney family became her chief consolation; their journey into
                        Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s
                        removal would at least restore peace to every heart but his own. But Captain
                        Tilney had at present no intention of removing; he was not to be of the
                        party to Northanger; he was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this,

                            least her good behaviour, is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of
                            Captain Tilney? Is he safe only in solitude? Or is her heart constant to

                            that real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no

                        between the lovers to excite her uneasiness, or make her quit them in
                        apprehension. James was in excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly
                        placid. Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her
                        heart; but that at such a moment was allowable; and once she gave her lover
                        a flat contradiction, and once she drew back her hand; but Catherine
                        remembered Henry’s instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection.

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry
                        to lose their young friend, whose good humour and cheerfulness had made her
                        a valuable companion, and in the promotion of whose enjoyment their own had
                        been gently increased. Her happiness in going with Miss Tilney, however,
                        prevented their wishing it otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one
                        more week in Bath themselves, her quitting them now would not long be felt.
                        Mr. Allen attended her to Milsom Street, where she was to breakfast, and saw
                        her seated with the kindest welcome among her new friends; but so great was
                        her agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful was
                        she of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to preserve
                        their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first five minutes,
                        she could almost have wished to return with him to Pulteney

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Miss Tilney’s manners and
                        Henry’s smile soon did away some of her unpleasant feelings; but still she
                        was far from being at ease; nor could the incessant attentions of the
                        general himself entirely reassure her. Nay, perverse as it seemed, she
                        doubted whether she might not have felt less, had she been less attended to.
                        His anxiety for her comfort &#8212; his continual solicitations that she
                        would eat, and his often-expressed fears of her seeing nothing to her taste
                        &#8212; though never in her life before had she beheld half such variety on
                        a breakfast-table &#8212; made it impossible for her to forget for a moment
                        that she was a visitor. She felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew
                        not how to reply to it. Her tranquillity was not improved by the general’s
                        impatience for the appearance of his eldest son, nor by the displeasure he
                        expressed at his laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. She was
                        quite pained by the severity of his father’s reproof, which seemed
                        disproportionate to the offence; and much was her concern increased when she
                        found herself the principal cause of the lecture, and that his tardiness was
                        chiefly resented from being disrespectful to her. This was placing her in a
                        very uncomfortable situation, and she felt great compassion for Captain
                        Tilney, without being able to hope for his goodwill.</said></p>

                        out, though there were three people to go in it, and his daughter’s maid had
                        so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to

                        influenced by this apprehension when he handed her in, that she had some
                        difficulty in saving her own new writing-desk from being thrown out into the
                        street. At last, however, the door was closed upon the three females, and
                        they set off at the sober pace in which the handsome, highly fed four horses
                        of a gentleman usually perform a journey of thirty miles: such was the
                        distance of Northanger from Bath, to be now divided into two equal stages.
                        Catherine’s spirits revived as they drove from the door; for with Miss
                        Tilney she felt no restraint; and, with the interest of a road entirely new
                        to her, of an abbey before, and a curricle behind, she caught the last view
                        of Bath without any regret, and met with every milestone before she expected
                        it. The tediousness of a two hours’ wait at Petty France, in which there was
                        nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about without
                        anything to see, next followed &#8212; and her admiration of the style in
                        which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four &#8212; postilions
                        handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, and numerous
                        outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent
                        inconvenience. Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would
                        have been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed
                        always a check upon his children’s spirits, and scarcely anything was said
                        but by himself; the observation of which, with his discontent at whatever
                        the inn afforded, and his angry impatience at the waiters, made Catherine
                        grow every moment more in awe of him, and appeared to lengthen the two hours
                        into four. At last, however, the order of release was given; and much was
                        Catherine then surprised by the general’s proposal of her taking his place

                        a wood fire &#8212; nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room
                        without windows, doors, or furniture. But you must be aware that when a
                        young lady is (by whatever means) introduced into a dwelling of this kind,
                        she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family. While they snugly
                        repair to their own end of the house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy,
                        the ancient housekeeper, up a different staircase, and along many gloomy
                        passages, into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it
                        about twenty years before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not
                        your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber &#8212;
                        too lofty and extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp
                        to take in its size &#8212; its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures
                        as large as life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet,
                        presenting even a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within

                        examine the furniture of your apartment! And what will you discern? Not
                        tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers, but on one side perhaps the
                        remains of a broken lute, on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts
                        can open, and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior,
                        whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be
                        able to withdraw your eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by
                        your appearance, gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few
                        unintelligible hints. To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason
                        to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted,
                        and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With
                        this parting cordial she curtsies off &#8212; you listen to the sound of her
                        receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you &#8212; and when,
                        with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover, with
                        increased alarm, that it has no lock.”</said></p>

                        sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy. Well, what then?”</said></p>

                <p><said direct="true" aloud="true" who="aus.003.til">“Nothing further to alarm
                        perhaps may occur the first night. After surmounting your unconquerable
                        horror of the bed, you will retire to rest, and get a few hours’ unquiet
                        slumber. But on the second, or at farthest the third night after your
                        arrival, you will probably have a violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as
                        to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the
                        neighbouring mountains &#8212; and during the frightful gusts of wind which
                        accompany it, you will probably think you discern (for your lamp is not
                        extinguished) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest.
                        Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for
                        indulging it, you will instantly arise, and throwing your dressing-gown
                        around you, proceed to examine this mystery. After a very short search, you
                        will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy
                        the minutest inspection, and on opening it, a door will immediately appear
                        &#8212; which door, being only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you
                        will, after a few efforts, succeed in opening &#8212; and, with your lamp in
                        your hand, will pass through it into a small vaulted room.”</said></p>

                        much frightened to do any such thing.”</said></p>

                        given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication
                        between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles
                        off? Could you shrink from so simple an adventure? No, no, you will proceed
                        into this small vaulted room, and through this into several others, without
                        perceiving anything very remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a
                        dagger, in another a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some
                        instrument of torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common
                        way, and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own
                        apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your eyes
                        will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold,
                        which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you had passed
                        unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will eagerly
                        advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into every drawer
                        &#8212; but for some time without discovering anything of importance &#8212;
                        perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At last, however, by
                        touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will open &#8212; a roll of
                        paper appears &#8212; you seize it &#8212; it contains many sheets of
                        manuscript &#8212; you hasten with the precious treasure into your own
                        chamber, but scarcely have you been able to decipher ‘Oh! Thou &#8212;
                        whomsoever thou mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched
                        Matilda may fall’ &#8212; when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and

                        suspended by his conversation on subjects very different &#8212; returned in
                        full force, and every bend in the road was expected with solemn awe to
                        afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey stone, rising amidst a grove of
                        ancient oaks, with the last beams of the sun playing in beautiful splendour
                        on its high Gothic windows. But so low did the building stand, that she
                        found herself passing through the great gates of the lodge into the very
                        grounds of Northanger, without having discerned even an antique

                        which she certainly had not expected. To pass between lodges of a modern
                        appearance, to find herself with such ease in the very precincts of the
                        abbey, and driven so rapidly along a smooth, level road of fine gravel,
                        without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity of any kind, struck her as odd and
                        inconsistent. She was not long at leisure, however, for such considerations.
                        A sudden scud of rain, driving full in her face, made it impossible for her
                        to observe anything further, and fixed all her thoughts on the welfare of
                        her new straw bonnet; and she was actually under the abbey walls, was
                        springing, with Henry’s assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the
                        shelter of the old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her
                        friend and the general were waiting to welcome her, without feeling one
                        awful foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment’s suspicion of
                        any past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze
                        had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her; it had wafted
                        nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake to
                        her habit, she was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room, and
                        capable of considering where she was.</said></p>

                        with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and ornaments over it of the
                        prettiest English china. The windows, to which she looked with peculiar

                        had endeavoured to alarm her by the description of. It was by no means
                        unreasonably large, and contained neither tapestry nor velvet. The walls
                        were papered, the floor was carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect
                        nor more dim than those of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not
                        of the latest fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room
                        altogether far from uncheerful. Her heart instantaneously at ease on this

                        package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed for her immediate accommodation,
                        when her eye suddenly fell on a large high chest, standing back in a deep
                        recess on one side of the fireplace. The sight of it made her start; and,
                        forgetting everything else, she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder,
                        while these thoughts crossed her:</said></p>

                        did not expect such a sight as this! An immense heavy chest! What can it
                        hold? Why should it be placed here? Pushed back too, as if meant to be out
                        of sight! I will look into it &#8212; cost me what it may, I will look into
                        it &#8212; and directly too &#8212; by daylight. If I stay till evening my
                        candle may go out.”</said>
                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">She advanced and examined it
                        closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker wood, and
                        raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the same. The
                        lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end were the imperfect
                        remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps prematurely by some
                        strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was a mysterious cipher, in
                        the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently, but without being able to
                        distinguish anything with certainty. She could not, in whatever direction
                        she took it, believe the last letter to be a T; and yet that it should be
                        anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of
                        astonishment.</said>

                        strange events could it have fallen into the Tilney family?</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">Her fearful curiosity was
                        every moment growing greater; and seizing, with trembling hands, the hasp of
                        the lock, she resolved at all hazards to satisfy herself at least as to its
                        contents. With difficulty, for something seemed to resist her efforts, she
                        raised the lid a few inches; but at that moment a sudden knocking at the
                        door of the room made her, starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with
                        alarming violence. This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney’s maid, sent by
                        her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately
                        dismissed her, it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing,
                        and forced her, in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to
                        proceed in her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick,
                        for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well
                        calculated to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment
                        upon a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At
                        length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette seemed
                        so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be
                        indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate should be the
                        exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by supernatural means, the
                        lid in one moment should be thrown back. With this spirit she sprang
                        forward, and her confidence did not deceive her. Her resolute effort threw
                        back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton
                        counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed
                        possession!</said></p>

                        some minutes an absurd expectation, was then added the shame of being caught

                        the strongest conviction of the wind’s force. A glance at the old chest, as
                        she turned away from this examination, was not without its use; she scorned
                        the causeless fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy
                        indifference to prepare herself for bed.</said>

                        old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in a situation conspicuous
                        enough, had never caught her notice before. Henry’s words, his description
                        of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first,
                        immediately rushed across her; and</said>

                        as she held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key
                        was in the door,</said>
                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">and she had a strange fancy

                        but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged, she tried
                        it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself successful;</said>

                    <said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">She paused a moment in
                        breathless wonder. The wind roared down the chimney, the rain beat in
                        torrents against the windows, and everything seemed to speak the awfulness
                        of her situation. To retire to bed, however, unsatisfied on such a point,
                        would be vain, since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a
                        cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore,
                        she applied herself to the key, and after moving it in every possible way
                        for some instants with the determined celerity of hope’s last effort, the
                        door suddenly yielded to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such
                        a victory, and having thrown open each folding door, the second being
                        secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though
                        in that her eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small
                        drawers appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and
                        in the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in all
                        probability a cavity of importance.</said></p>

                        straining with curiosity, her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and
                        drew it forth. It was entirely empty. With less alarm and greater eagerness
                        she seized a second, a third, a fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was
                        left unsearched, and in not one was anything found. Well read in the art of
                        concealing a treasure, the possibility of false linings to the drawers did
                        not escape her, and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in

                        and not vain, as hitherto, was her search; her quick eyes directly fell on a
                        roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity, apparently
                        for concealment, and her feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her
                        heart fluttered, her knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized,
                        with an unsteady hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed
                        to ascertain written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful
                        sensations this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold,
                        resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to
                    rest.</said></p>

                        candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm; but there was no danger of
                        its sudden extinction; it had yet some hours to burn; and that she might not
                        have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its
                        ancient date might occasion, she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed
                        and extinguished in one. A lamp could not have expired with more awful
                        effect. Catherine, for a few moments, was motionless with horror. It was
                        done completely; not a remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the
                        rekindling breath. Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A
                        violent gust of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the
                        moment. Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded,
                        a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on
                        her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat stood
                        on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping her way to
                        the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of agony by
                        creeping far underneath the clothes.</said>

                        justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated, repose must be
                        absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful! She had not been
                        used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast seemed fraught with awful
                        intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully found, so wonderfully
                        accomplishing the morning’s prediction, how was it to be accounted for? What
                        could it contain? To whom could it relate? By what means could it have been
                        so long concealed? And how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot
                        to discover it! Till she had made herself mistress of its contents, however,
                        she could have neither repose nor comfort; and with the sun’s first rays she
                        was determined to peruse it.</said>

                        noises, more terrific even than the wind, which struck at intervals on her
                        startled ear. The very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion,
                        and at another the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of
                        somebody to enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and
                        more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour
                        after hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed

                        sides of the quadrangle, rich in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for
                        admiration. The remainder was shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant
                        plantations, and the steep woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter,
                        were beautiful even in the leafless month of March. Catherine had seen
                        nothing to compare with it; and her feelings of delight were so strong, that
                        without waiting for any better authority, she boldly burst forth in wonder
                        and praise. The general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as
                        if his own estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that

                        including church-yard and orchard. The walls seemed countless in number,
                        endless in length; a village of hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a
                        whole parish to be at work within the enclosure. The general was flattered
                        by her looks of surprise, which told him almost as plainly, as he soon
                        forced her to tell him in words, that she had never seen any gardens at all

                        opportunity for the proposed examination of the mysterious apartments. It
                        was Sunday, and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was
                        required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home; and
                        great as was Catherine’s curiosity, her courage was not equal to a wish of
                        exploring them after dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between
                        six and seven o’clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger
                        illumination of a treacherous lamp. The day was unmarked therefore by
                        anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant
                        monument to the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family
                        pew. By that her eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal
                        of the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her by

                        religious retirement closed their black career. The erection of the monument
                        itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs. Tilney’s
                        actual decease. Were she even to descend into the family vault where her

                        promised something better. The general’s early walk, ill-timed as it was in
                        every other view, was favourable here; and when she knew him to be out of
                        the house, she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her
                        promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige her; and Catherine reminding her as
                        they went of another promise, their first visit in consequence was to the
                        portrait in her bed-chamber. It represented a very lovely woman, with a mild
                        and pensive countenance, justifying, so far, the expectations of its new
                        observer; but they were not in every respect answered, for Catherine had
                        depended upon meeting with features, hair, complexion, that should be the
                        very counterpart, the very image, if not of Henry’s, of Eleanor’s &#8212;
                        the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking, bearing
                        always an equal resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken
                        for generations. But here she was obliged to look and consider and study for
                        a likeness. She contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback, with
                        much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left it
                        unwillingly.</said></p>

                        were advancing. Again she passed through the folding doors, again her hand

                        rushed forward to the one in question. The lock yielded to her hand, and,

                        to a modest tranquillity. She did not learn either to forget or defend the
                        past; but she learned to hope that it would never transpire farther, and
                        that it might not cost her Henry’s entire regard. Her thoughts being still
                        chiefly fixed on what she had with such causeless terror felt and done,
                        nothing could shortly be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary,
                        self-created delusion, each trifling circumstance receiving importance from
                        an imagination resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one
                        purpose by a mind which, before she entered the abbey, had been craving to
                        be frightened. She remembered with what feelings she had prepared for a
                        knowledge of Northanger. She saw that the infatuation had been created, the
                        mischief settled, long before her quitting Bath, and it seemed as if the
                        whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which she had
                        there indulged.</said></p>

                        with James. Her only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella.
                        James had protested against writing to her till his return to Oxford; and

                            April</said></p>
                        <p><said direct="true" aloud="false" who="aus.003.isa">My dearest Catherine,
                                I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have
                                a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner. I really
                                am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid place one can
                                find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to begin a
                                letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have always
                                been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to me
                                soon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave this vile place
                                tomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it &#8212;
                                the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I
                                believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest, for you are
                                dearer to me than anybody can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your
                                dear brother, not having heard from him since he went to Oxford; and
                                am fearful of some misunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all
                                right: he is the only man I ever did or could love, and I trust you
                                will convince him of it. The spring fashions are partly down; and
                                the hats the most frightful you can imagine. I hope you spend your
                                time pleasantly, but am afraid you never think of me. I will not say
                                all that I could of the family you are with, because I would not be
                                ungenerous, or set you against those you esteem; but it is very
                                difficult to know whom to trust, and young men never know their
                                minds two days together. I rejoice to say that the young man whom,
                                of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. You will know,
                                from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may
                                remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before you
                                went away. Afterwards he got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many
                                girls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but
                                I knew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two
                                days ago, and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. He is
                                the greatest coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The
                                last two days he was always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied
                                his taste, but took no notice of him. The last time we met was in
                                Bath Street, and I turned directly into a shop that he might not
                                speak to me; I would not even look at him. He went into the
                                pump-room afterwards; but I would not have followed him for all the
                                world. Such a contrast between him and your brother! Pray send me
                                some news of the latter &#8212; I am quite unhappy about him; he
                                seemed so uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, or something
                                that affected his spirits. I would write to him myself, but have
                                mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he took
                                something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his
                                satisfaction; or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from
                                himself to me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all
                                to rights. I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play,
                                except going in last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half
                                price: they teased me into it; and I was determined they should not
                                say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by
                                the Mitchells, and they pretended to be quite surprised to see me
                                out. I knew their spite: at one time they could not be civil to me,
                                but now they are all friendship; but I am not such a fool as to be
                                taken in by them. You know I have a pretty good spirit of my own.

                    directly settled that, till she had, her leaving them was not even to be thought

                    was determined, were such sweet proofs of her importance with them, as left her
                    only just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably without.
                    She did &#8212; almost always &#8212; believe that Henry loved her, and quite
                    always that his father and sister loved and even wished her to belong to them;
                    and believing so far, her doubts and anxieties were merely sportive

                        when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start; it
                        seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway &#8212; and in another
                        moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it. She
                        trembled a little at the idea of anyone’s approaching so cautiously; but
                        resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or
                        misled by a raised imagination, she stepped quietly forward, and opened the
                        door. Eleanor, and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine’s spirits, however,
                        were tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor’s cheeks were pale, and
                        her manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it

                        went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. She tried
                        to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her
                        friend comfortable; but she had no appetite, and could not swallow many
                        mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room
                        gave her fresh misery, and strengthened her distaste for everything before

                        in one corner of the carriage, in a violent burst of tears, she was conveyed
                        some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head; and the

                        and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it, she was
                        preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went; first,
                        in the appearance of her carriage &#8212; and secondly, in herself. The
                        chaise of a traveller being a rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were
                        immediately at the window; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a
                        pleasure to brighten every eye and occupy every fancy &#8212; a pleasure
                        quite unlooked for by all but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of
                        six and four years old, who expected a brother or sister in every carriage.
                        Happy the glance that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that
                        proclaimed the discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful
                        property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood.</said></p>

                        Catherine’s heart; and in the embrace of each, as she stepped from the
                        carriage, she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed
                        possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she was even happy! In the joyfulness
                        of family love everything for a short time was subdued, and the pleasure of
                        seeing her, leaving them at first little leisure for calm curiosity, they
                        were all seated round the tea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the

                        explanation on his father’s account he had to give; but his first purpose
                        was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen’s grounds he had
                        done it so well that Catherine did not think it could ever be repeated too
                        often. She was assured of his affection; and that heart in return was
                        solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally knew was already entirely his
                        own; for, though Henry was now sincerely attached to her, though he felt and
                        delighted in all the excellencies of her character and truly loved her
                        society, I must confess that his affection originated in nothing better than
                        gratitude, or, in other words, that a persuasion of her partiality for him
                        had been the only cause of giving her a serious thought. It is a new
                        circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an
                        heroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild

                        and proudly communicative; and being at that time not only in daily
                        expectation of Morland’s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well
                        resolved upon marrying Catherine himself, his vanity induced him to
                        represent the family as yet more wealthy than his vanity and avarice had
                        made him believe them. With whomsoever he was, or was likely to be
                        connected, his own consequence always required that theirs should be great,
                        and as his intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their
                        fortune. The expectations of his friend Morland, therefore, from the first
                        overrated, had ever since his introduction to Isabella been gradually
                        increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the
                        moment, by doubling what he chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland’s
                        preferment, trebling his private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and sinking
                        half the children, he was able to represent the whole family to the general
                        in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the peculiar object of
                        the general’s curiosity, and his own speculations, he had yet something more
                        in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand pounds which her father could
                        give her would be a pretty addition to Mr. Allen’s estate. Her intimacy
                        there had made him seriously determine on her being handsomely legacied

                        such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never had it occurred to
                        him to doubt its authority. Thorpe’s interest in the family, by his sister’s
                        approaching connection with one of its members, and his own views on another
                        (circumstances of which he boasted with almost equal openness), seemed
                        sufficient vouchers for his truth; and to these were added the absolute
                        facts of the Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland’s being
                        under their care, and &#8212; as soon as his acquaintance allowed him to
                        judge &#8212; of their treating her with parental kindness. His resolution
                        was soon formed. Already had he discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in
                        the countenance of his son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe’s communication, he
                        almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his boasted
                        interest and ruining his dearest hopes. Catherine herself could not be more
                        ignorant at the time of all this, than his own children. Henry and Eleanor,
                        perceiving nothing in her situation likely to engage their father’s
                        particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance,
                        and extent of his attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had
                        accompanied an almost positive command to his son of doing everything in his
                        power to attach her, Henry was convinced of his father’s believing it to be
                        an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at
                        Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations which
                        had hurried him on. That they were false, the general had learnt from the
                        very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom he had chanced
                        to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of exactly opposite
                        feelings, irritated by Catherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a
                        very recent endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and
                        Isabella, convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a

                        for after coming eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between
                        the families, with the most liberal proposals, he had, on being brought to

                        himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent support. They

                        himself. He blushed for the narrow-minded counsel which he was obliged to
                        expose. The conversation between them at Northanger had been of the most
                        unfriendly kind. Henry’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been
                        treated, on comprehending his father’s views, and being ordered to acquiesce
                        in them, had been open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary
                        occasion to give the law in his family, prepared for no reluctance but of
                        feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words,
                        could ill brook the opposition of his son, steady as the sanction of reason
                        and the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, his
                        anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was sustained
                        in his purpose by a conviction of its justice. He felt himself bound as much
                        in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing that heart to be
                        his own which he had been directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a
                        tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his
                        fidelity, or influence the resolutions it prompted.</said></p>

                        intention of offering her his hand. The general was furious in his anger,
                        and they parted in dreadful disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind
                        which many solitary hours were required to compose, had returned almost
                        instantly to Woodston, and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun

                        their heads to suspect an attachment on either side; but as nothing, after
                        all, could be more natural than Catherine’s being beloved, they soon learnt
                        to consider it with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far
                        as they alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His

                        impossible for them to sanction the engagement. Their tempers were mild, but
                        their principles were steady, and while his parent so expressly forbade the
                        connection, they could not allow themselves to encourage it. That the
                        general should come forward to solicit the alliance, or that he should even
                        very heartily approve it, they were not refined enough to make any parading
                        stipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that
                        once obtained &#8212; and their own hearts made them trust that it could not
                        be very long denied &#8212; their willing approbation was instantly to
                        follow. His consent was all that they wished for. They were no more inclined
                        than entitled to demand his money. Of a very considerable fortune, his son
                        was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his present income was an
                        income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view, it was a
                        match beyond the claims of their daughter.</said></p>

                        surprised at a decision like this. They felt and they deplored &#8212; but
                        they could not resent it; and they parted, endeavouring to hope that such a
                        change in the general, as each believed almost impossible, might speedily
                        take place, to unite them again in the fullness of privileged affection.
                        Henry returned to what was now his only home, to watch over his young
                        plantations, and extend his improvements for her sake, to whose share in
                        them he looked anxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to
                        cry. Whether the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine
                        correspondence, let us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did &#8212;
                        they had been too kind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received
                        a letter, as, at that time, happened pretty often, they always looked
                        another way.</said></p>

                        state of their attachment must be the portion of Henry and Catherine, and of
                        all who loved either, as to its final event, can hardly extend, I fear, to
                        the bosom of my readers, who will see in the tell-tale compression of the
                        pages before them, that we are all hastening together to perfect felicity.
                        The means by which their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt:
                        what probable circumstance could work upon a temper like the general’s? The
                        circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his daughter with a
                        man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of the summer
                        &#8212; an accession of dignity that threw him into a fit of good humour,
                        from which he did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained his
                        forgiveness of Henry, and his permission for him</said>

                        Tilney, her removal from all the evils of such a home as Northanger had been
                        made by Henry’s banishment, to the home of her choice and the man of her
                        choice, is an event which I expect to give general satisfaction among all
                        her acquaintance. My own joy on the occasion is very sincere. I know no one
                        more entitled, by unpretending merit, or better prepared by habitual
                        suffering, to receive and enjoy felicity. Her partiality for this gentleman
                        was not of recent origin; and he had been long withheld only by inferiority
                        of situation from addressing her.</said>

                        Any further definition of his merits must be unnecessary; the most charming
                        young man in the world is instantly before the imagination of us all.
                        Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to add &#8212; aware
                        that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a character not
                        connected with my fable &#8212; that this was the very gentleman whose
                        negligent servant left behind him that collection of washing-bills,
                        resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my heroine was involved
                        in one of her most alarming adventures.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">The influence of the viscount
                        and viscountess in their brother’s behalf was assisted by that right
                        understanding of Mr. Morland’s circumstances which, as soon as the general
                        would allow himself to be informed, they were qualified to give. It taught
                        him that he had been scarcely more misled by Thorpe’s first boast of the
                        family wealth than by his subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no
                        sense of the word were they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would
                        have three thousand pounds. This was so material an amendment of his late
                        expectations that it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his pride;
                        and by no means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he
                        was at some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at
                        the disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every
                        greedy speculation.</said></p>

                <p><said who="aus.003.nar" direct="true" aloud="false">On the strength of this, the
                        general, soon after Eleanor’s marriage, permitted his son to return to
                        Northanger, and thence made him the bearer of his consent, very courteously
                        worded in a page full of empty professions to Mr. Morland. The event which
                        it authorized soon followed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells
                        rang, and everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth
                        from the first day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the
                        dreadful delays occasioned by the general’s cruelty, that they were
                        essentially hurt by it. To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of
                        twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover
                        convinced that the general’s unjust interference, so far from being really
                        injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by
                        improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their
                        attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether
                        the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or
                        reward filial disobedience.</said></p>
